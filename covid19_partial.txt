 the staff has undergone on-line 36-hour training course to become qualified in coronavirus infection treatment
the surgeons of covid-19 dedicated hospitals do rarely practice surgery
the majority of the studies dedicated to colorectal diseases are temporarily paused
the approach to patient routing has changed significantly
 if one is not diagnosed with covid-19 ct scan and laboratory testing are provided immediately
 the patients should be admitted to the surgical department where treatment is provided only to those covid-19 negative
 those treated in infectious diseases hospital or covid-19 dedicated centre are managed by the surgical team present
surgery has become highly elective being mostly available for high-risk patients with emergencies malignancies cardiovascular pathologies or infections

surgery for benign disorders precancerous lesions and reconstructive procedures are currently postponed
 regarding colorectal cancer surgical treatment may be postponed if it is a non-obstructing disease 7 
laparoscopic surgery and diathermy are limited as well
 more efforts should be taken to expand the amount and types of surgical procedures performed

0000028b5cc154f68b8a269f6578f21e31f62977   according to current live statistics at the time of editing this letter russia has been the third country in the world to be affected by covid-19 with both new cases and death rates rising
 it remains in a position of advantage due to the later onset of the viral spread within the country since the worldwide disease outbreak
the first step in fighting the epidemic was nationwide lock down on march 30 th  2020
most of the multidisciplinary hospitals have been repurposed as dedicated covid-19 centres so the surgeons started working as infectious disease specialists
 such a reallocation of health care capacity results in the effective management of this epidemiological problem 1 
 the staff has undergone on-line 36-hour training course to become qualified in coronavirus infection treatment
the surgeons of covid-19 dedicated hospitals do rarely practice surgery
 when icu patients need mechanical ventilation percutaneous tracheostomy under endoscopic control is mostly performed as it decreases the aerosol formation viral load on staff and complications associated with an endotracheal tube in comparison with surgical tracheostomy 2 
 however it is still associated with the risk of aerosol formation so different approaches should be considered for a long-time perspective 3 
the majority of the studies dedicated to colorectal diseases are temporarily paused
 the teaching and training are mostly translated via online platforms which has excluded the opportunity to get clinical experience in surgery 4 
the approach to patient routing has changed significantly
 if one is not diagnosed with covid-19 ct scan and laboratory testing are provided immediately
 the patients should be admitted to the surgical department where treatment is provided only to those covid-19 negative
the patient isolated for more than 2 weeks and covid-19 negative as a result of 2 subsequent tests is admitted to the surgical department with an option to readmission to the infectious department and can be treated by surgical staff which does not work with covid-19 positive patients
the patient diagnosed with coronavirus infection and treated at home is admitted to covid-19 dedicated multidisciplinary hospital where surgical care is provided
 those treated in infectious diseases hospital or covid-19 dedicated centre are managed by the surgical team present
surgery has become highly elective being mostly available for high-risk patients with emergencies malignancies cardiovascular pathologies or infections
 preoperative testing in surgical patients with respiratory symptoms and history of travelling or contacting with covid-19 positive people and postoperative recovery in the operating unit seem to be highly effective measures 5 
 a lot of rearrangements are performed locally regarding personal protective equipment the organization of scrubbing donning and doffing and dedicated changing areas
 moreover observational departments are organized in surgical hospitals for patient allocation before coronavirus infection status is defined 6 
surgery for benign disorders precancerous lesions and reconstructive procedures are currently postponed
 regarding colorectal cancer surgical treatment may be postponed if it is a non-obstructing disease 7 
laparoscopic surgery and diathermy are limited as well
 the importance of special operating theatre for covid-19 patients with negative pressure ventilation unidirectional laminar flow as well as the use of smoke evacuation systems during surgery are taken into account 8 
such an electiveness of surgery is concerning as it might cause a worldwide healthcare catastrophe in the post-pandemic era 5 
 more efforts should be taken to expand the amount and types of surgical procedures performed
due to the early preventive and corrective actions we have already reached the plateau in new cases curve counting for up to 8 984 cases identified at the time of writing this paper june 7 th  2020 with a mortality rate of 1⋅5075
 these statistical outcomes are resulted by a 68-day lockdown admission regime and healthcare rearrangement
 thus the multistep restriction lifting has already started to consistently recover in both social and economic aspects

 for isolation of individual cells the small blocks were mechanically separated using two needles
 the cell suspension was then centrifuged at 400 â g for 10 min at 4 8c
 the cells from the pyogranulomas and the exudate of cat 2 were stained together
the first staining was performed to determine the viability and the monocytemacrophage nature of the fipv positive cells

fipv positive cells were found in cell suspensions from exudates and pyogranulomas in all cats
 the percentage of fipv positive cells varied from 1 to 10 table 3 
 less than 1 of the fipv positive cells showed a polymorphonuclear nucleus
staining 2 revealed that no infected cells showed expression of viral antigens on their surface fig
 re-expression only occurred in 52 ae 10 of infected cells fig
 1 of mhc i expression was observed between live and dead cells
the results of the viability staining staining 1 are given in table 3 
1 whereas no difference was observed in exudates between fipv positive monocytes and the control cells
 it is not known which mechanism lies behind the absence of surface expressed viral antigens
 this observation is consistent with the in vitro findings of dewerchin et al
 they showed that 50 of fipv 79-1146 infected monocytes do not express viral antigens on the plasma membrane
 another possibility is antibody-induced capping of viral antigens and extrusion from the cell
besides antibody-mediated elimination of virusinfected cells cytotoxic t lymphocytes ctls are also capable of killing infected cells
 during an infection viral peptides are loaded on mhc i molecules and transported to the plasma membrane
 this complex may be recognized by ctls which leads to killing of the infected cell
 in this study the presence of mhc i on fipv positive cells was analyzed
with the exception of two cats higher cell death in infected cells seems to be present in pyogranulomas
 in exudates this observation was not made
 the cause of this difference between pyogranulomas and exudates is not clear
 since no viral antigens are present on the plasma membrane it can be stated that antibody-mediated lysis is inhibited
 the precise role of the cellular immune response in protection needs to be further investigated
 in contrast mhc i molecules are abundantly present on their surface

 no surface expression of viral antigens was detected on fipv positive cells
 mhc i molecules were present on all the fipv positive cells
 after cultivation of the isolated infected cells 52 ae 10 of the infected cells re-expressed viral antigens on the plasma membrane
in conclusion it can be stated that in fip cats fipv replicates in cells of the monocytemacrophage lineage without carrying viral antigens in their plasma membrane which could allow them to escape from antibody-dependent cell lysis

 1 of mhc i expression was observed between live and dead cells
the results of the viability staining staining 1 are given in table 3 
 this staining showed that the percentage of dead fipv positive monocytes in pyogranulomas was significantly higher than the control cells fipv negative dh95b positive cells  p  0
1 whereas no difference was observed in exudates between fipv positive monocytes and the control cells
in this study it was shown that fipv positive monocytes in cats with fip express mhc i on their surface but not viral antigens
the presence of viral antigens on the cell surface of infected cells is important for the recognition and elimination of infected cells by the immune system
 binding of virus-specific antibodies to viral proteins present on the surface makes infected cells recognizable for the classical complement pathway phagocytes and natural killer cells which will lead to lysis of infected cells harper 1994 
 in this study viral antigens were not detected on the surface of fipv positive cells isolated from nine cats with fip
 this could implicate that the fipv positive cells may remain invisible for the humoral immune system and continue the production of progeny virus without being eliminated
 it is not known which mechanism lies behind the absence of surface expressed viral antigens
 the results of the cultivation experiment demonstrated that about half of the infected cells are not capable of expressing viral antigens on their surface
 this observation is consistent with the in vitro findings of dewerchin et al
 2005 
 they showed that 50 of fipv 79-1146 infected monocytes do not express viral antigens on the plasma membrane
the absence of viral antigens on the surface of fipv positive cells isolated from fip cats that seem to be capable of expressing viral antigens can be due to the fact that virus-specific antibodies bind to the antigens and as a consequence the viral antigens are internalized
 another possibility is antibody-induced capping of viral antigens and extrusion from the cell
 since the antibody-induced internalization has been described in in vitro infected monocytes that do show surface expressed viral antigens it most likely occurs also in vivo dewerchin et al
 2006 
the fact that viral antigens could not be demonstrated with the used staining is not the result of antibodies present in the cat that already bound to these antigens and hinder binding of other antibodies
 this hindering is not likely to occur since in fipvinfected crandell feline kidney cells surface expressed fipv antigens covered by strain specific antibodies were still accessible for other antibodies data not shown
besides antibody-mediated elimination of virusinfected cells cytotoxic t lymphocytes ctls are also capable of killing infected cells
 during an infection viral peptides are loaded on mhc i molecules and transported to the plasma membrane
 this complex may be recognized by ctls which leads to killing of the infected cell
 in this study the presence of mhc i on fipv positive cells was analyzed
 on all fipv positive cells mhc i was present showing that no internalization or retention of the mhc i molecules occurs
 however with the used techniques it was not possible to quantify the number of mhc i molecules and to determine whether the mhc i molecules were loaded with fipv peptides
with the exception of two cats higher cell death in infected cells seems to be present in pyogranulomas
 in exudates this observation was not made
 the cause of this difference between pyogranulomas and exudates is not clear
 the increased cell death may be due to infection or to the response of the immune system on the infected cell
 since no viral antigens are present on the plasma membrane it can be stated that antibody-mediated lysis is inhibited
 the expression of mhc i is not inhibited in infected cells indicating that the cellular immunity may still be able to lyse the infected cell if viral peptides are presented
 it is generally accepted that a strong cellular immunity enables the cat to overcome infection pedersen and black 1983 hayashi et al
 1982 weiss and cox 1989 
 however it has also been postulated that during a chronic fipv infection the cell-mediated lysis is inhibited due to apoptosis and t-cell depletion caused by soluble mediators released during infection haagmans et al
 1996 de groot-mijnes et al
 2005 
 taking into account all these observations it becomes clear that the outcome of a fipv infection is a complicated interaction of the immune system and the virus
 one thing is sure the humoral immune response is not able to protect the cat against progression of viral replication and consequently of disease
 the precise role of the cellular immune response in protection needs to be further investigated
in conclusion it can be stated that cytoplasmic fipv-infected cells do not show surface expressed viral antigens in vivo which may make them invisible for the humoral immune response
 in contrast mhc i molecules are abundantly present on their surface

 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded ribonucleic acid rna virus and has been identified as the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 disease 1 
 to avoid uncontrolled viral spread high-throughput testing and subsequent isolation of infected individuals was advised 2 
 however due to limited laboratory testing capacities only symptomatic individuals could be tested in the beginning of the 2020 pandemic 3 
 on the other hand it has been shown that a large proportion of individuals remain asymptomatic
 therefore a clinical definition of covid-19 is not reliable and laboratory confirmation of sars-cov-2 is currently advised for confirmation 4 
 as asymptomatic patients tested positive for sars-cov-2 the lack of test capacity resulted in a lack of knowledge of the underlying true infection risk 5 6 
 since then test capacities have been upscaled but there is still an urgent need for reliable and cost-effective high-throughput testing methods specifically as regulations are currently easing and loci of rapid spread need to be detected as early as possible to avoid uncontrolled viral spread
mass spectrometric ms techniques have largely complemented or replaced traditional methods in laboratory medicine toxicology microbiology as well as molecular pathology and are suitable for reliable cost-effective and rapid detection of amplified polymerase chain reaction pcr products 7 8 9 10 11 
 thus this method has a great potential to complement the current diagnostic arsenal especially in times where a shortage of reagents may limit the application of real-time reverse transcriptase rrt-pcr which is the current gold standard for the detection of sars-cov-2 12 
therefore we established and tested a ms-based test protocol for its ability to detect sars-cov-2 from oral or nasopharyngeal swabs and compared the results to rrt-pcr
oral or nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from patients and transferred to the laboratory in viral transport medium
 rna isolation and rrt-pcr for sars-cov-2 detection were conducted at the same day institute for immunology and genetics kaiserslautern
 a total of 22 samples that tested positive and 22 samples that tested negative were selected and tested with a sars-cov-2 ms assay in two independent laboratories institute for immunology and genetics kaiserslautern and institute for molecular pathology trier within two weeks after rrt-pcr
 samples were obtained from corona screening centers from two local hospitals in the period from march 14 2020 to april 24 2020
 ms and rrt-pcr results were compared
 informed written consent has been obtained from all the patients

83 agena bioscience which listed all samples the quality control and sars-cov-2 status followed by details on each individual sars-cov-2 target
 the lod of the respective kit was 10 genome copies per reaction
 the assay was designed to detect the following sars-cov-2 targets viral nucleocapsid genes n1 2 and 3 genome areas 28653-28760 28880-28978 28076-28190 orf1abnsp3 and orf1abnsp10 genome areas 3223-3335 and 13342-13432 table 1 
 all assay components exhibit 100 sequence homology to conserved sars-cov-2 regions except for the forward pcr primer for the sc2n2 assay
 according to the sequence data as of may 20 2020 8 of the sars-cov-2 sequences have a three-nucleotide mismatch with the first three 5 end nucleotides of the sc2n2 forward pcr primer 22 nucleotide length
 this results in the 86 pcr primer homology for the 8 of sars-cov-2 population and the 98
9 weighted homology
 the mismatch is located at the 5 end of the pcr primer and does not affect the test performance 13 
 samples were identified as positive if ≥2 sars-cov-2 targets were detected and the qc passed invalid if the qc failed and negative if 2 sars-cov-2 targets were detected and the qc passed

 data are presented as absolute numbers and percentage as well as median and range
for 43 of 44 patient samples basic clinical data were available
 30 70 patients were male and 13 30 female
 mean age was 43 min-max 7-77
all samples included in the study n  44 were successfully analyzed by rrt-pcr and the ms test system
 none of the 44 samples failed quality control
 positive and negative test results were concordant in all samples
 a representative example of a positive and a negative result of both tests is shown in figures 1 and 2 
time-to-results of the rrt-pcr the ms test were 120 min and 480 min respectively
 hands-on-time of the rrt-pcr and the ms test were 40 min for both  table 2 
 viruses 2020 12 x for peer review 4 of 9 a total of six coronaviruses are known to cause human disease from which two strains sars-cov-2 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus are thought to be zoonotic and have been associated with more severe potentially fatal outcomes 14 
sars-cov-2 is an enveloped single-stranded positive-sense rna virus and belongs to the genus of beta-coronaviruses is spherical in shape about 60-140 nm in diameter and has 9-12 nm long characteristic spikes on the surface 15 
 this virus has been identified as the causative agent of covid-19 disease after the world health organization country office was informed about cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology in wuhan city hubei province in china on 31 december 2019 12 
 to detect infection with sars-cov-2 saliva sputum oral or nasopharyngeal swabs stool anal swabs blood or urine can be analyzed and highest rates of detection have been reported for sputum oral or nasopharyngeal swabs 16 
 however the peak diagnostic yield might depend on the time of onset of symptoms 17 
 in this study we tested material derived from oral and nasopharyngeal swabs
the genome of a typical cov contains a 5 untranslated region utr a conserved replicase domain orf1ab including the rdrp gene four genes s e m and n to encode structural proteins spike envelope membrane and nucleocapsid proteins a 3 utr and several unidentified non-structural orfs which are potential targets for their detection 18 
 these gene regions may be used to identify infection with sars-cov-2
interestingly recommendations regarding which gene regions should be targeted to identify the virus are highly variable
 for example in the us three genes targeting the n-gene are recommended for emergency testing in germany the charité recommends the identification of the e gene for screening and identification of the rdrp gene for confirmation 12 
 the latter recommendation is based on the fact that the region of the e gene is commonly shared between sars-cov-2 and other bat or human related sars viruses and the rdrp sequence is specific for sars-cov-2 12 
 generally two to three targets need to be detected to qualify as a reliable result 18 
 moreover an internal quality control is currently recommended which is also in the ms detection kit 18 
the analysis of rrt-pcr may be affected by false-negative and false-positive results
 in this regard it has been shown that multiple testing in the course of disease can improve the rate of viral detection 4 16 19 20 21 
 one study found that in 21
4 of patients a positive detection of sars-cov-2 could only be achieved after two consecutive negative results 21 
 interestingly 16
7 of patients with typical features of covid-19 pneumonia on a computer tomography scan were negative by rrt-pcr half of these patients became positive after the second test and half of the remaining patients became positive after the third test 4 
 it was found that the rrt-pcr results from several tests at different time points were variable from the same patients during the course of diagnosis and treatment 19 
 this might explain the fact that only about 50 of clinically confirmed cases are confirmed by a positive rrt-pcr result
 as a consequence a negative rrt-pcr should not lead to the false assumption that the patient is not infected by sars-cov-2 and clinical parameters need to be considered 20 22 
 to avoid false-negative results due to testing failures standardized collection transport conditions storage extraction and amplification procedures of patient material are needed
 interestingly thermal inactivation reduced the detectable amount of sars-cov-2 in rrt-pcr runs and would be expected also for our ms test
 on the other hand inactivation by guanidinium-based lysis exhibited less effects 23 
besides rrt-pcr gold standard alternative techniques such as isothermal amplification methods and ms are available for the detection of viruses 24 25 
 ms has been successfully used for the detection of viral dna rna or proteins in previous studies 26 27 28 
 the method is fast with a turnaround time of max
 1 day and therefore suitable for routine use 29 
 however to the best of our knowledge there have been no reports on the application of ms for the detection of sars-cov-2 to date
 we show that i rrt-pcr is the fastest method to detect sars-cov-2 ii hands-on-time is comparable between rrt-pcr and the ms method and iii results are concordant between both assays
in summary we report on the application of ms as a reliable and fast method for the detection of sars-cov-2
 since there is a shortage of reagents at several places alternative methods that complement rrt-pcr and are dependent on alternative reagents are highly beneficial to tackle the 2020 covid-19 pandemic
 
 specific guidance for immunocompromised patients regarding covid-19 was pushed out quickly
 appointments for immunocompromised patients were converted to virtual visits or deferred if possible before appointments for other patients
 however the data thus far has not borne this out
 a hyperinflammatory response to covid-19 may cause a cytokine storm syndrome driving severe and deadly cases of covid-19
 advanced older age as a risk factor for covid-19 infection and death has been well substantiated
 1 lay press articles paint the at risk elderly as our grandparents nursing home residents or retirees
 14 the case fatality rate for individuals in the 60-69 age group was an unreassuring 3
6 in china and hospitalizations in this age group are extremely common
0003793cf9e709bc2b9d0c8111186f78fb73fc04   how do we protect our high-risk patient populations this was the dominant focus of our coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 neurology departmental meeting at the start of the epidemic weeks ago where a neurologist in his late 50s assured us we were at minimal danger from coronavirus and our efforts should focus on protecting our high-risk patients
 but do we know exactly who these high-risk people are although there was limited data to guide them our hospital the cdc 1 and various medical associations repeated the intuitive refrain that high risk patients are the immunocompromised and elderly
a hospital-wide high-risk patient working group was established early on consisting of neuroimmunologists and other physicians across disciplines that care for immunocompromised individuals
 specific guidance for immunocompromised patients regarding covid-19 was pushed out quickly
 appointments for immunocompromised patients were converted to virtual visits or deferred if possible before appointments for other patients
the inclusion of immunocompromised patients in the high-risk population for covid-19 is intuitive-immunosuppression should make a person more likely to contract an infection and may prolong the disease course
 however the data thus far has not borne this out
 early analyses of large chinese cohorts have identified risk factors such as older age hypertension chronic respiratory diseases and cardiovascular diseases but not immunosuppression as risk factors for disease severity in covid-19
 2 in addition data on prior related coronavirus outbreaks in mers 3 and sars 4 did not show any evidence of increased risk of infection or morbidity in immunocompromised populations
with the current outbreak reports of 2 heart transplant recipients 5 and the first renal transplant recipient 6 with covid-19 infection showed a clinical course recovery and laboratory profile similar to that of immunocompetent patients
 a pediatric liver transplant center in italy reported no significant pulmonary disease from covid-19 amongst their patients with autoimmune liver disease on chemotherapy or those who were post-transplant
 7 an analysis from china did note increased rates of infection and morbidity in cancer patients 8 however it did not adjust for age included patients many years out from their cancer treatments and has been the subject of several responses that contest the conclusion of increased risk to cancer patients
 910 indeed one response raised the point that decreased access to quality medical care rather than the virus itself is the primary danger facing cancer patients in the current pandemic
 10 no data exists regarding other transplant rheumatologic or neuroimmunological conditions which itself prompts the question of whether these patients are indeed at higher risk than the general population
not only has evidence that immunosuppression causes increased risk in covid-19 been lacking there is also a theoretical argument that immunosuppression may be therapeutic
 a hyperinflammatory response to covid-19 may cause a cytokine storm syndrome driving severe and deadly cases of covid-19
 11 clinical investigations into the utility of various immunosuppressive agents in covid-19 including tocilizumab an il-6 inhibitor janus kinus jak inhibitors and others are ongoing
 12 instead of focusing on immunosuppression we need to re-consider who qualifies as an elderly person in regards to covid-19 risk
 advanced older age as a risk factor for covid-19 infection and death has been well substantiated
 over 1 out of 5 patients in italy over the age of 80 succumbed to the disease 13 and according to the cdc 31-70 of confirmed covid-19 patients over the age of 85 in the united states require hospitalization
 1 lay press articles paint the at risk elderly as our grandparents nursing home residents or retirees
 and yet while the very elderly in their 80s are most severely affected by the disease the median age of hospitalized patients with severe covid-19 in a large retrospective study in china was only 52 years
 14 the case fatality rate for individuals in the 60-69 age group was an unreassuring 3
5 in italy and 3
6 in china and hospitalizations in this age group are extremely common
 13 morbidity may peak in societys oldest members but anyone older than 50 is far from safe and many in this group represent our health care workers grocery store employees government leaders caregivers and other members of society serving essential functions in the midst of this crisis
 unlike immunocompromised individuals average adults in their 50s or 60s may never have thought of themselves as vulnerable thus messaging about their elevated risk should be targeted and unambiguous
the data regarding risk factors for poor outcomes in covid-19 is far from definitive-as we learn more about this disease we may find that certain cancers neuroimmunologic conditions or immunosuppressive agents do indeed increase morbidity
 the medical complexity of some immunocompromised patients may itself lead to higher risk for nosocomial infections or complications related to hospitalization
 those in their 80s and 90s are at the highest risk from this infection and we must do everything we can to protect them
 however as health professionals focus on immunocompromised and elderly patients in our public health messaging we send an implicit message that others have made explicit that those outside of these groups are safer
 paradoxically the physician in his late 50s speaking about protecting high-risk immunocompromised patients at our hospital meeting may himself be at higher risk than many of the immunocompromised patients he seeks to protect
 these issues are consequential-some multiple sclerosis patients are considering delays in their immunosuppressive regimens due to the pandemic older healthcare workers are coming out of retirement to work on the frontlines and there is ongoing debate in government about the who will be at risk when we reopen society
 it is time to urgently begin the discussion within the medical community on how to target accurate messaging to those at highest risk

hereafter the term nanoparticle collectively refers to nanowires nws nanospheres nss and nanoflakes nfs
 this planar assembly was vacuum-formed into the desired surface geometry  fig
 1b  and then subjected to fls  fig
 the dependence of interconnect resistance and shape on the forming strain fls fluence and nanomaterial shape are examined
 in particular variation in nanomaterial shape is affected by mixing nws nss  nfs in different concentrations
 the process capability is further demonstrated via a simple conformal led-lighting circuit for relatively complex 3d surfaces
 nw-nf inks were also prepared in a similar method with the aforementioned concentrations
 printing nanomaterials of this concentration and size has also been performed by largearea printheads without a mask 16 
 during printing the sample stage was preheated to 70⁰c to quickly evaporate the ethanol
 for process characterization the printed pattern was a straight-line interconnect
 the in-plane stage motion was controlled by g-codes
 the number of printing passes was maintained at 140 in order to retain similar interconnect thickness across different samples
 the tg for pc was measured using differential scanning calorimetry to be 153 ℃

5 characterized by a maximum mold angle θm  60⁰  fig
 1 c was used to characterize the effect of nanomaterial compositions on post-forming resistance
 this setup was adapted so that uniaxial strain was imposed on the interconnect along the pyramid slope
 the vacuum-forming process took about 30 seconds to complete
 this vacuum-formed assembly was subjected to fls sinteron 3000 system xenon corporation
 this lamp has a minimum optical footprint and therefore working area of 1-foot x 1 inch
 in this equation q depends on distance d the fraction of total optical irradiance at given wavelength λ i
4 denotes the total optical irradiance at a given voltage at the focal plane as specified by the manufacturer
 the base of the formed pc was fixed at 0
5 inches away from the lamp focal plane and the lamp voltage was fixed at 3 kv
 the focal plane of the light is located at 1 inch from the lamp casing
 the optical fluence at the pc base was varied as 57  9 jcm 2  with single optical pulse
 the interconnect morphology was analyzed via scanning electron micrography sem zeiss sigma field emission 8100
 the optical absorption of thedeposited ag nws was measured using an uv-vis spectrophotometer
 the sintering temperature was measured with an optical pyrometer
 post-fls resistance decreases with increase in optical fluence for all configurations
 the blowoff occurs due to nanoscale degradation and evaporation of nws beyond a limiting fluence 15 
 however for samples mixed with higher ns or nf content are less prone to fls induced damage
 3a -d show sem images after forming and after fls
 clustering of nfs or nss at nw-nw junctions is observable
 the size of the aggregate formation is bigger at higher concentrations for both nfs and nss
 lower number of contact points and higher neck growth is desirable for better percolation of electrons 20 21 
 also interconnects containing nw-ns or nw-nf mixtures sustain higher optical fluence energy than pure nws
 it is observed that the nw-nf configuration samples have greater optical absorption than other samples
 pure nws showed very low optical absorption characteristics
 this is because nfs have greater optical absorption than nws 22 23 
 therefore nw-nf ensemble results in greater optical absorption characteristics than only nws
 this phenomenon is applicable to nw-ns mixtures as well
 sintering temperatures were measured at the root section of the formed samples for 5jcm 2 optical fluence  fig
 the 25 nf sample had the highest sintering temperature at 237
5 ⁰c and pure nws sample had the lowest sintering temperature at 193
 figure 4 b shows that sintering temperatures increase with greater non-nw content for both nw-nf and nw-ns configurations
 the lowest post-fls resistance here ≈ 10 ωcm resistivity of 55
 thus fls plays a key role in compensating for the increase in resistance after vacuum-forming
 the change in resistivity with respect to forming angle is plotted in figure 4 c
 it is observed that change in resistivities post-forming  post-fls are comparable at lower forming angles 30⁰  40⁰
 at higher forming angles 50⁰  60⁰ the change in resistivity is non-linear
 this is due to greater strain on the nws as the forming angle increases
  5a  and the concavo-convex geometry fig 5b 
 the pcinterconnect assemblies were adhesively integrated with the mold surface and connected to an led-photoresistor circuit
this paper discusses the influence of nanomaterial shape morphology on line resistance in the form-fuse process
 this leads to greater nw-nw neck growth and resulted in observed post-fls resistance decrease

 this lamp has a minimum optical footprint and therefore working area of 1-foot x 1 inch
 the thermal power density q absorbed at an arbitrary location on the 3d interconnect was obtained as shown in eq
 1
 in this equation q depends on distance d the fraction of total optical irradiance at given wavelength λ i
e
 xλ ratio of absorbed power pa λ to incident power pi λ on the interconnect and the lamp voltage v in kv
 the term v3120 2
4 denotes the total optical irradiance at a given voltage at the focal plane as specified by the manufacturer
 the base of the formed pc was fixed at 0
5 inches away from the lamp focal plane and the lamp voltage was fixed at 3 kv
 the focal plane of the light is located at 1 inch from the lamp casing
 the optical fluence at the pc base was varied as 57  9 jcm 2  with single optical pulse
 the interconnect resistance was quantified by attaching copper tapes with highly conductive silver paste to the end-pads of the interconnects
 the interconnect morphology was analyzed via scanning electron micrography sem zeiss sigma field emission 8100
 the optical absorption of thedeposited ag nws was measured using an uv-vis spectrophotometer
 the sintering temperature was measured with an optical pyrometer
 post-fls resistance decreases with increase in optical fluence for all configurations
 at higher fluence 9jcm 2  blowoff is visually observed in pure ag nw cases as in past work 17 18 
 the blowoff occurs due to nanoscale degradation and evaporation of nws beyond a limiting fluence 15 
 the missing data points in figures 2c and 2f denote that there is no conductivity across the interconnect to measure resistance
 however for samples mixed with higher ns or nf content are less prone to fls induced damage
 figs
 3a -d show sem images after forming and after fls
 clustering of nfs or nss at nw-nw junctions is observable
 the size of the aggregate formation is bigger at higher concentrations for both nfs and nss
 these clusters were observed across the interconnect after deposition and are caused due to the presence of surface defects on the nanoflakes  nanospheres 19 
 lower number of contact points and higher neck growth is desirable for better percolation of electrons 20 21 
 figure 2 shows that the change in line resistance between post-forming and post-fls is much greater in mixed configurations and further increases with an increase in nf or ns content than pure nw samples
 also interconnects containing nw-ns or nw-nf mixtures sustain higher optical fluence energy than pure nws
 400 to 700 nm
 it is observed that the nw-nf configuration samples have greater optical absorption than other samples
 pure nws showed very low optical absorption characteristics
 this is because nfs have greater optical absorption than nws 22 23 
 therefore nw-nf ensemble results in greater optical absorption characteristics than only nws
 this phenomenon is applicable to nw-ns mixtures as well
 sintering temperatures were measured at the root section of the formed samples for 5jcm 2 optical fluence  fig
  4b 
 the 25 nf sample had the highest sintering temperature at 237
5 ⁰c and pure nws sample had the lowest sintering temperature at 193
2 ⁰c
 figure 4 b shows that sintering temperatures increase with greater non-nw content for both nw-nf and nw-ns configurations
 hence it is safe to assume that the incident optical energy from the flash lamp is effectively absorbed by the nss or nfs
 the heat generated due to optical absorption is transferred to nw-nw junctions to facilitate interparticle neck growth thus resulting in a greater change in post-fls line resistance for nw-ns or nw-nf samples as shown in figure 2 
 thus nanomaterial shape plays a key role in reducing the line resistance after fls so that neck growth induced reduction in resistance due to fls can overcome the concurrent increase in resistance due to vacuum-forming
 the lowest post-fls resistance here ≈ 10 ωcm resistivity of 55
4 µω-cm is achieved in pure ag nw samples sintered at 5jcm 2 optical energy  fig 5a  which is considered as the optimal fluence in this work
 in order to achieve lower manufacturing costs interconnects containing nw-ns mixtures and sintered at higher fluence can be used to achieve resistance similar to that of pure nws sample
 but if the optical fluence or the ns content is greater than a certain optimum the resistance will increase due to blowoff
 thus fls plays a key role in compensating for the increase in resistance after vacuum-forming
 the change in resistivity with respect to forming angle is plotted in figure 4 c
 it is observed that change in resistivities post-forming  post-fls are comparable at lower forming angles 30⁰  40⁰
 at higher forming angles 50⁰  60⁰ the change in resistivity is non-linear
 this is due to greater strain on the nws as the forming angle increases
 our process with optimal parameters was used to integrate conductive interconnects on more complex surfaces such as the stepped geometry  fig
  5a  and the concavo-convex geometry fig 5b 
 the pcinterconnect assemblies were adhesively integrated with the mold surface and connected to an led-photoresistor circuit
this paper discusses the influence of nanomaterial shape morphology on line resistance in the form-fuse process
 addition of nss or nfs in nws expand the useable fluence range by alleviating blowoff but at the cost of lower conductivity
 the non-linear dependence of line-resistance on the addition of nss or nfs was explained using sem characterization uv-vis spectroscopy and temperature measurements
 uv-vis and temperature measurements show that addition of nfs or nss results in greater optical absorption due to size and shape effects
 this leads to greater nw-nw neck growth and resulted in observed post-fls resistance decrease
 note that the scale of this form-fuse process can be increased by using large area printheads along with commercial vacuum-forming machines and linearly placed sintering lamps
 the demonstrated process also enables high throughput and circuit repairability and wide material window which makes this process versatile and independent of object size and shape
 however there are several unanswered questions such as why is there a significant change in line resistance from post-forming to post-fls for samples containing nfs or nss when compared to nws only cases does localized optical absorption or sintering kinetics or both drive this change the reasoning behind these questions will be discussed in our future work

the characteristics of the 20 sars patients are summarized in table 1

 oseltamivir tamiflu was also given initially to treat possible influenza infection
the longitudinal trends of plasma th1th2 cytokines and inflammatory cytokines of the 20 sars patients are illustrated in fig
 in contrast there was no significant increase in proinflammatory cytokine tnf-a in all sars patients
 anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 was found to increase in some but not all patients no overall significance
 the other seven patients had milder disease severity and were not treated with pulsed steroid
 these 5-8-day post-treatment concentrations were also significantly lower than those of 1-2 days after treatment all p  0·05
this study was designed to investigate prospectively the longitudinal plasma cytokine and chemokine profile of adult patients with sars
 il-6 may play a proinflammatory role in pulmonary inflammation 23 
 il-12 can induce the production of ifn-g and other th1 cytokines with suppression of the th2 pathway 26 27 
 therefore pmn-induced acute pneumonitis should be crucial in the pathogenesis of ards and pulmonary destruction in sars patients
 consistently our results showed that both circulating ifn-g and ip-10 were increased in sars patients
 these suggest that sars-cov does not enhance the th2 pathway and the subsequent humoral immue response
 such imbalance of th1th2 cytokine profile confirms the sars-covinduced th1 predominance
 in contrast to h5n1 infection 15  plasma tnf-a was not elevated in our patients
 this finding therefore does not support the therapeutic use of tnf-a monoclonal antibody for sars
 however it must be cautioned that the concentration of tnf-a at the pulmonary inflammatory sites has not been investigated
 moreover the t cell chemokines mig and rantes also did not show any significantly elevation
 this further supports that the above cytokines and chemokines played impor-tant roles in the immunopathological mechanisms of sars
 we have initiated a study comparing plasma cytokines and chemokines in sars patients with and without corticosteroid treatment
 therefore the role of tgf-b in sars also requires investigation
00039b94e6cb7609ecbddee1755314bcfeb77faa  severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is a recently emerged infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus but its immunopathological mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated
 we investigated changes in plasma t helper th cell cytokines inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in 20 patients diagnosed with sars
 cytokine profile of sars patients showed marked elevation of th1 cytokine interferon ifn-g  inflammatory cytokines interleukin il-1 il-6 and il-12 for at least 2 weeks after disease onset but there was no significant elevation of inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor tnf-a  anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 th1 cytokine il-2 and th2 cytokine il-4
 the chemokine profile demonstrated significant elevation of neutrophil chemokine il-8 monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mcp-1 and th1 chemokine ifn-g -inducible protein-10 ip-10
 corticosteroid reduced significantly il-8 mcp-1 and ip-10 concentrations from 5 to 8 days after treatment all p  0·001
 together the elevation of th1 cytokine ifn-g  inflammatory cytokines il-1 il-6 and il-12 and chemokines il-8 mcp-1 and ip-10 confirmed the activation of th1 cell-mediated immunity and hyperinnate inflammatory response in sars through the accumulation of monocytesmacrophages and neutrophils
 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is a recently emerged infectious disease characterized by persistent fever respiratory symptoms with lung consolidation lymphopenia and respiratory failure in life-threatening cases 1 2 3 4 
 watery diarrhoea has also been manifested in some cases 5 
 we found that lymphopenia and depletion of cd4 and cd8 t lymphocytes could be associated with disease activity and adverse outcomes in sars 4 
 the sars-related deaths have resulted mainly from pulmonary complications including progressive respiratory failure due to alveolar damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards
 the causative agent of sars has been identified as a new coronavirus sars-cov 6 7 8 with a genome sequence that is only moderately related to other known coronaviruses 9 10 
 rapid diagnostic tests using molecular techniques for the detection of sars-cov rna have been developed recently 11 12 
 administration of the antiviral drug ribarivin together with systemic corticosteroid resulted in alleviation of inflammation reduction of organ dysfunction and improvement on survival in the majority of sars patients 1 5 13  although controlled clinical trials are required to confirm this regimens genuine efficacy
it has been shown that the over-production of specific inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor tnf-a  interleukin il-1 b  il-6 il-10 and polymorphonuclear neutrophil pmn cc chemokine il-8 is the hallmark of viral infection probably through the activation of transcription factor nuclear factor nf-k b activator protein ap-1 and activating factor-2 atf-2 14 
 for example the h5n1 avian flu influenza viruses are potent inducers of proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf-a in macrophages 15 
 in swine pneumonia the production of tnf-a and il-6 was found to correlate positively with disease severity 16 
 therefore sars sequalae such as transendothelial migration of pmn into lung tissue multiple organ dysfunction and ards have been postulated to associate with cytokine and chemokine dysregulation 17 18 
 in an attempt to study possible sars-cov-induced cytokine and chemokine dysregulation to identify markers for disease severity and to explore the feasibility of designing effective treatment strategy such as anti-cytokine therapy we have prospectively investigated a panel of circulating t helper th cell cytokines inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in patients with sars
our study included 20 consecutive adult patients who were diagnosed to have sars and admitted to the prince of wales hospi-tal hong kong for treatment from 20 march to 11 april 2003

 the diagnosis of sars was confirmed by an indirect immunofluorescence assay with fetal rhesus kidney cells that were infected with coronavirus and fixed in acetone to detect a serological response to the sars-cov 7  or by a positive viral culture
 our protocol was approved by the clinical research ethics committee of the chinese university of hong kong and informed consent was obtained from all participants

 because the more commonly used procedure of enzymelinked immunosorbent assay elisa may generate infectious droplets and aerosols t helper th1th2 cytokines inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in plasma were measured serially by cytometric bead array cba using a four-colour facscalibur flow cytometer becton dickinson ca usa located in a biosafety level ii laboratory 20 21 
 in cba five or six bead populations with distinct fluorescence intensities had been coated with capturing antibodies specific for different cytokines or chemokines
 these bead populations could be resolved in the fluorescence channels of the flow cytometer
 after the beads had been incubated with 50 m l of plasma different cytokines or chemokines in the sample were captured by their corresponding beads
 the cytokinechemokine captured beads were then mixed with phycoerythrin-conjugated detection antibodies to form sandwich complexes
 following incubation washing and acquisition of fluorescence data the results were generated in graphical format using the bd cba software

 the coefficients of variation for all cytokine and chemokine assays were less than 10
 their respective normal ranges have been derived from measurement of ≥ 100 healthy subjects
because plasma cytokine and chemokine concentrations were not in a gaussian distribution the mann-whitney rank sum test was used for assessing their differences

the characteristics of the 20 sars patients are summarized in table 1 
 coincidentally all except one were female patients although the female-to-male ratio of the 1755 sars patients in this outbreak in hong kong as well as that of the 290 patients none of the 20 sars patients recruited in this study died or required admission to the intensive care unit icu
 initial treatment included antibiotics cefotaxime and clarithromycin or levofloxacin to cover common pathogens causing community-acquired pneumonia
 oseltamivir tamiflu was also given initially to treat possible influenza infection
 after fever had persisted for more than 48 h and leukopenia thrombocytopenia or both had developed oral ribavirin 40-60 mgkgday and oral prednisolone 1 mgkgday were started as a combined regimen from 2 to 9 days after disease fever onset
 patients who did not respond clinically to standard empirical treatment including persistent fever increasing shortness of breath worsening lung opacities involving  50 of lung field in chest radiograph and deteriorating oxygen saturation to  90 by pulse oximetry were given intravenous ribavirin 400 mg every 8 h and an additional one to three pulses of 0·5 g of methylprednisolone sodium succinate methylprednisolone daily
the longitudinal trends of plasma th1th2 cytokines and inflammatory cytokines of the 20 sars patients are illustrated in fig
 1 
 th1 cytokine ifn-g and inflammatory cytokines il-1 b  il-6 and il-12 concentrations were significantly elevated above their normal range respectively within the first 12 7 and 5 days after disease onset all p  0·05
 in contrast there was no significant increase in proinflammatory cytokine tnf-a in all sars patients
 anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 was found to increase in some but not all patients no overall significance
 the plasma concentrations of th1 cytokine il-2 and th2 cytokine il-4 of all patients were low and within their respective normal range at all time points data not shown
 as shown in fig
 2  plasma pmn cc chemokine il-8 monocyte cc chemokine mcp-1 and th1 cxc chemokine ip-10 concentrations were elevated respectively within the first 9 3 and 14 days after disease onset all p  0·05
 the overall plasma concentrations of t cell chemoattractants namely cxc chemokine mig and cc chemokine rantes were not significantly elevated
among the 20 sars patients in our cohort 13 had more severe disease activity including persistent fever and worsening lung opacities they were additionally given intravenous pulsed methylprednisolone
 the other seven patients had milder disease severity and were not treated with pulsed steroid
 figure 3 shows that plasma ifn-g  il-1 b  il-6 il-8 ip-10 and mcp-1 of the former group of patients had higher median concentrations than those of the latter particularly from day 3-10 after disease onset
 following recovery the cytokine and chemokine levels decreased progressively to normal values at about 1 week after disease onset for both groups of patients
as summarized in table 2  plasma chemokine il-8 ip-10 and mcp-1 were significantly reduced to their respective normal ranges from 5 to 8 days after corticosteroid treatment compared to the elevated pretreatment levels all p  0·005
 these 5-8-day post-treatment concentrations were also significantly lower than those of 1-2 days after treatment all p  0·05
 all the other measured cytokines and chemokines il-1 b  il-6 il-10 il-12p70 tnf-a  ifn-g  rantes and mig did not show any significant difference before and after corticosteroid treatment
this study was designed to investigate prospectively the longitudinal plasma cytokine and chemokine profile of adult patients with sars
 the progression of this potentially lethal disease may be represented by three phases acute viral multiplication hyperactive immune response recovery or pulmonary destruction and death 1 4 5 
 accordingly it is worthwhile to investigate cytokine and chemokine induction which may be the cause or consequence of immune hyperactivity in sars
 we observed that for at least 2 weeks after disease onset all sars patients exhibited a significant increase in the typical antiviral th1 cytokine ifn-g and an array of proinflammatory cytokines il-1 b  il-6 and il-12 together with a moderate increase in anti-inflammatory il-10 that was manifested in some patients
 il-1 b can act as the early response cytokine to viral infection such as that caused by the human immunodeficiency virus for mediation of inflammatory response synthesis of acute phase proteins and release of il-8 14 22 
 il-6 may play a proinflammatory role in pulmonary inflammation 23 
 th2 cytokine il-10 is an antiinflammatory cytokine that suppresses the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines 24  therefore it was elevated in some patients 1 week after disease onset and followed the elevation of other inflammatory cytokines
 il-12 also known as natural killer nk cell stimulatory factor or cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor is a pleiotropic proinflammatory cytokine which is produced primarily by antigen-presenting cells monocytes macrophages dendritic cells and b cells and pmn 25 
 il-12 can induce the production of ifn-g and other th1 cytokines with suppression of the th2 pathway 26 27 
 it has multiple effects on t lymphocytes and nk cells including the ability to stimulate cytotoxicity proliferation cytokine production and the development of th1 subsets 28 29 
 therefore the observed early elevation of inflammatory cytokines il-1 b  il-6 il-12 and ifn-g could be causative of the sars-cov-induced activation of th1 cells and nk cells release of chemokines such as il-8 and results in pulmonary inflammation 16 
a previous study has suggested that the infiltration of proinflammatory pmn is involved in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury 30 
 pmn are abundant in the airspaces of most ards patients with infection and their secretory products such as myeloperoxidase and elastase in bronchoalveolar lavage bal fluid can cause acute lung injury 31 32 33 
 il-8 the pmn achemokine has been shown to be elevated in blood and alveolar spaces 34 and exhibit a positive correlation with the number of pmn in bal fluid of patients with pneumonia and ards 35 
 our sars-cov-infected patients also showed elevation of plasma il-8 soon after disease onset which declined from 5 to 8 days after corticosteroid treatment
 in our former clinical study 82 of 157 sars patients developed neutrophilia and the high neutrophil counts were associated with icu admission and mortality from pneumonia 4 
 therefore pmn-induced acute pneumonitis should be crucial in the pathogenesis of ards and pulmonary destruction in sars patients
apart from the a -chemokine il-8 we have also observed elevation of the monocytemacrophages b -chemokine mcp-1 soon after the onset of sars followed by decline after corticosteroid treatment
 mcp-1 concentration has been shown to increase in bal fluid of patients with persistent ards 36  correlating positively with the predominance of alveolar macrophages 37 that has also been found in the postmortem examination of sars patients 2 38 
 ip-10 is a specific chemoattractant for th1 cells for the activation of cell-mediated immune response its expression can be up-regulated by the th1 cytokine ifn-g in acute lung inflammation 39 
 consistently our results showed that both circulating ifn-g and ip-10 were increased in sars patients
 our observation of low or normal th2 cytokine il-4 in sars patients is also similar to the finding of a previous study of viral pneumonia 40 
 these suggest that sars-cov does not enhance the th2 pathway and the subsequent humoral immue response
 such imbalance of th1th2 cytokine profile confirms the sars-covinduced th1 predominance
 in contrast to h5n1 infection 15  plasma tnf-a was not elevated in our patients
 this finding therefore does not support the therapeutic use of tnf-a monoclonal antibody for sars
 however it must be cautioned that the concentration of tnf-a at the pulmonary inflammatory sites has not been investigated
 previous studies have implicated that inflammatory il-b and the acute-phase cytokine il-6 are endogenous pyrogens or inducers of fever 41 
 therefore elevations of il-b and il-6 might account for the fever onset as both of them were found to have high plasma concentrations during the first week of disease
 moreover the t cell chemokines mig and rantes also did not show any significantly elevation
 therefore the recruitment of activated t cells in pulmonary tissue should be studied by performing chemokine assay and differential cell count in bal fluids although this should be difficult because of the high risk of infection
in summary we postulate that the elevation of the plasma chemokines il-8 mcp-1 and ip-10 th1-related cytokine ifn-g and il-12 and inflammatory cytokines il-1b and il-6 can induce the hyperinnate inflammatory response due to the sars-cov invasion of the respiratory tract
 this leads to the recruitment and accumulation of alveolar macrophages and pmn 42  as well as the activation of th1 cell-mediated immunity by the stimulation of nk and cytotoxic t lymphocytes ctl
 treatment with immunosuppressive corticosteroid can significantly suppress the elevated chemokines il-8 ip-10 and mcp-1 and subsequently alleviate the chemokine-associated pulmonary inflammation in sars
 indeed the reduction in il-8 ip-10 and mcp-1 correlated with the improvement in general clinical condition pulmonary function and radiological appearance in sars patients of our present study
 in addition we also observed that higher disease severity was associated with more elevated plasma ifn-g il-1b il-6 il-8 ip-10 and mcp-1 concentrations fig
 3 
 it can be postulated that the addition of pulsed steroid in the severe-disease group not only controlled the rapidly deteriorating clinical condition but basically attenuated the otherwise over-exaggerated immunological response with potentially much high median concentrations of plasma cytokines and chemokines
 this further supports that the above cytokines and chemokines played impor-tant roles in the immunopathological mechanisms of sars
 we have initiated a study comparing plasma cytokines and chemokines in sars patients with and without corticosteroid treatment
 the elevated plasma cytokines and chemokines should also shed light on the possibility of using them as prognostic indicators for disease severity in sars
 for example the presence of high anti-il-8  il-8 complexes in bal fluid has been shown to be an important prognostic indicator for ards 43 
although our study has provided some understanding of the immunological mechanisms of inflammation in sars and the therapeutic effects of corticosteroid many further investigations are required to explore the detailed pathophysiology of this novel emerging disease with global impact
 in order to correlate cytokine release with disease severity in vitro mechanistic study of cytokine induction using sars-cov and immune cell culture and eventually the measurement of cytokine and chemokine concentrations at local inflammatory sites should be contemplated
 other chemokines such as epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide ena-78 a neutrophil chemoattractant 30  and macrophage inflammatory peptide-1 alpha mip-1a a monocyte chemoattractant 30  should be measured
 recently transforming growth factor tgf-b has been shown to be active early in acute lung injury and potentially contribute to the development of pulmonary oedema 44 
 therefore the role of tgf-b in sars also requires investigation
 given the prominent roles of cytokines and chemokines in the pathogenesis of sars anticytokine chemokine immunotherapy using anticytokinechemokine antibodies e

 anti-il-8 anti-mcp-1 or cytokinechemokine antagonists may represent a novel approach for the treatment of hyperactive inflammation in sars 45 46

 population
 in chicago one of the nations hotspots african american make up 42 of the cases and 56 of the deaths from the virus 1 there are several pathways that contribute to racial disparities in covid-19 cases and death
first we must consider biological underpinnings that are specific to covid-19
 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is the entry receptor utilized by covid-19 and is thought to negatively regulate the activated renin-angiotensin system by diverting the generation of vasoconstrictor angiotensin ii angii towards the inactive ang 1-9 and vasodilatatory ang 1-7 peptides
 a few studies have found racial differences in ace2 activity showing african americans produce higher levels of angii and demonstrate lower ace2 activity 3 
 studies have shown that downregulation of ace2 expression is involved in lung pathology after sars-cov infection and elevations in angii have been directly related to covid-19 severity 4 
 hence dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system may place african americans at disproportionate risk for severe covid-19 outcomes
the second and perhaps most critical factor relates to health disparities
 african americans disproportionally account for 45 of vascular-related diseases and are 37 more likely to develop lung cancer than whites despite lower exposure to cigarette smoke
 social determinant factors like economic stability education and the environment directly impact issues related to access and quality of health care which fuel health disparities
 furthermore there is evidence of medical bias in the testing and treatment of african-american with covid-we must ask ourselves why do these social inequities persist despite decades of scientific evidence showing its damaging effects on health we believe the answer lies in a close examination of structural forms of racism and discrimination towards african americans
historically african americans have been a target group for racism and discrimination which has created a deep mistrust for societal systems -often undermined as paranoia
 specific to covid-19 african americans are overrepresented in essential jobs therefore employment may interfere with the ability to stay at home and social distance
 we must not forget that stay at home orders and social distancing carries an assumption of socioeconomic privilege i
e
 the ability to work from home and transition from in-person communications to online platforms
covid-19 has brought these longstanding issues to light in a stark way
 what is less appreciated are the biological consequences of structural racism and discrimination
 increasing evidence support the effects of racial discrimination on biological function
 first altered immune function hypothalamic-pituitary axis hpa dysfunction and metabolic changes secondary to stress can contribute to medical co-morbidities such as type 2 diabetes hypertension and asthma all of which increase covid-19 risk
 everyday discrimination is a stressor that has been linked to poor health inflammation and premature cellular aging 6 
 hence discrimination experiences may also explain why african americans are at a disproportionately higher risk for poor medical e
g
 cardiovascular disease metabolic hypertension and psychiatric outcomes e
g
 depression anxiety
disparities in health outcomes may also reflect dysfunctions in the bodys innate immediate and adaptive prolonged immune responses which are evolutionarily designed to defend against and prevent the spread of pathogens
 during initial exposure to a new pathogen tolllike receptors play a critical role in innate and inflammatory immune responses
 dysfunctional alterations in the adaptive immune response may promote a cytokine storm whereby the immune system begins to attack its own cells and tissues 7 which has been seen in severe cases of covid-19
the field of social genomics has uncovered how certain marginalized groups demonstrate abnormal patterns of gene expression in genes responsible for innate immunity termed the conserved transcriptional response to adversity ctra 8 
 ctra refers to a common pattern of transcriptional alterations that is activated by chronic low-grade activation of the sympathetic nervous system sns
 the ctra profile is characterized by increased expression of genes involved in inflammation and decreased expression of genes involved in innate antiviral responses and genes encoding specific isotypes of antibodies igg in particular
 experiences of racial discrimination have been found to explain more than 50 of the black-white differences in ctra particularly in genes that promote inflammation 9 
 together these studies provide a potential pathway as to how racism and discrimination alter host innate immunity to promote abnormal inflammatory responses
the neuropsychiatric sequelae of covid-19 have both direct and indirect pathways
 the direct pathway relates to the stress-induced inflammatory factors as described above that may increase risk for encephalopathies depression anxiety and trauma-related disorders 10 
 it is hypothesized that these neuropsychiatric manifestations could result from the virus-induced cytokine storm
the indirect pathway relates to measures to address the pandemic like social distancing as well as the economic toll of covid-19
 there is growing concern that these indirect consequences of covid-19 may contribute to isolation anxiety depression and increased rates of suicide 11 
as a result of these direct and indirect pathways african americans are specifically vulnerable to the neuropsychiatric consequences of covid-19
the crisis generated by the covid-19 pandemic has forced us to confront issues of inequality and health disparities
 while considerable efforts are being made to flatten the curve it does not negate the damage that has already been done particularly in the african american community
 while the virus is not thought to target specific racial or ethnic groups we cannot ignore that african americans have been disproportionately impacted
 as we think about getting past this crisis and getting back to normal the pandemic provides an opportunity to improve our health system to reduce disparities
 in sum understanding the key biological and psychosocial contributors to the ravishes of covid-19 in african americans highlights the need for more vigilance attention and efforts to improve health for all
 
 the alliedness of this health care professional group is an evolving entity that can no longer be overlooked
 specific recommendations are offered to improve recognition of rts and their professional identity within the healthcare system
 despite these mounting challenges they remain steadfast and committed to patient-centered care
notably health team members are collaborating in an interprofessional cooperative and coordinated manner to provide efficient and exceptional care
 3 this is an especially impressive achievement during a global pandemic such as covid-19
 such connectedness is crucial in identifying meaningful pathways toward providing relevant timely and wise medical decisions and interventions
 such identity according to porter and wilton 5 is a key factor in the functioning of interprofessional teams
 the construction of professional identity is defined by professional spaces and symbols
 these spaces and symbols constitute the overall organizational space
this space according to halford and leonard 6 is more than a passive backdrop to hospital life
 the symbolic part of the profession is evident with the uniforms badges names and titles attached to the profession
 additionally a culture of subservience and apathy is prevalent in radiologic technology profession
 this phenomenon is largely due to the role that the medical profession has assumed
 this dominance has persisted since the early 1900s when a hierarchal system was created within radiology departments
 this effect created cultural norms that effectively limited the role of rts within the department
 rts are front-line patient-care staff who play a key role in preserving an effectively operating medical imaging department
 11 in addition this profession is one of the most dangerous in frontline healthcare
 12 rts are trained health professionals who produce highquality medical images for radiologists and physicians
 as such rts are equally indispensable members of the healthcare team deserving of a distinct professional identity
 the integral and pivotal role of rts cannot be underestimated
 the alliedness of this health care professional group is an evolving entity that cannot be overlooked
 for several years the outstanding contributions of teachers policemen soldiers journalists artists and firemen have already been recognized
0003ddfb7ce19bcb3f38907f69676163b9863535  the value of professional identity is an interesting territory to explore relative to working in interprofessional teams and collaborative communities the collaborative opportunities provided to health care workers during covid-19 pandemic is a rare opportunity to underscore the silent yet significant identity of radiologic technologists as professionals
 historically and prior to the pandemic the role of radiologic technologists remains unfamiliar if not unrecognized in the philippine healthcare industry
 the alliedness of this health care professional group is an evolving entity that can no longer be overlooked
 the central and indispensable role played by radiologic technologists rts invites meaningful discussion and debate among peers and researchers to better describe the professional identity and role of the rt as an indispensable member of the interprofessional team
 specific recommendations are offered to improve recognition of rts and their professional identity within the healthcare system
 considered as the most important asset in the prevention and control of covid-19 1 the role that healthcare workers play in this global pandemic gives a renewed meaning of what true human service is all about
 healthcare workers face a wide array of risks and uncertainties in their day-to-day responsibilities as they do battle with covid-19
 despite these mounting challenges they remain steadfast and committed to patient-centered care
with the department of healths doh interim guidelines for emergency hiring of health personnel as the countrys clear and appropriate response to the covid-19 health emergency 2 the many members of the healthcare system are undoubtedly teeming with pride
 countless numbers of professionals are now adequately staffed and fueled with profound expertise good will and driven by an inspiring spirit of collaboration
notably health team members are collaborating in an interprofessional cooperative and coordinated manner to provide efficient and exceptional care
 3 this is an especially impressive achievement during a global pandemic such as covid-19
 protected with goggles gowns and gloves 3gs all healthcare professionals silently but competently work together to deliver life-giving life-sustaining and life-reviving services that make them an integral and highly connected system
 such connectedness is crucial in identifying meaningful pathways toward providing relevant timely and wise medical decisions and interventions
 this highly connected system among healthcare professionals is what touati et al 4 collectively call a collaborative community where reliance on rationality enables members to strategically coordinate their activities through a shared commitment to a set of ultimate goals
 though the word front liner is a generic label given to the healthcare professionals involved in combatting the perils of covid-19 the value of professional identity is an interesting territory to explore relative to working in interprofessional teams and collaborative communities
 such identity according to porter and wilton 5 is a key factor in the functioning of interprofessional teams
interestingly there is a growing attention paid to the substantial restructuring and banding of health professions from being referred to as allied to medicine to the emergence of a subculture where staff became allied to each other
 the construction of professional identity is defined by professional spaces and symbols
 these spaces and symbols constitute the overall organizational space
this space according to halford and leonard 6 is more than a passive backdrop to hospital life
 kolyva 7 for her part averred that a big difference exists between place and space with the former referring to the physical location and geography while the latter pertains to what is imagined and virtual
 though healthcare workers in a hospital or healthcare facility operate in the same building the practice of departmentalization creates a kind of physical and mental territoriality
 the symbolic part of the profession is evident with the uniforms badges names and titles attached to the profession
 interestingly the ways the material spaces are used and the meanings woven around hospital spaces who has which space how much space who can go where and for how long 6 8 are meaningful blocks that shape the professional identity that one assumes the meaningful interaction interrelatedness and interdependence of individuals in the context of space and materials form the identity that a particular profession assumes
the collaborative community and alliance of health care workers during covid-19 pandemic is a rare opportunity to underscore the silent yet significant identity of rts as professionals
 in fact even before this pandemic the role of radiologic technologists remains unfamiliar if not unrecognized in the philippine healthcare industry
 additionally a culture of subservience and apathy is prevalent in radiologic technology profession
 this phenomenon is largely due to the role that the medical profession has assumed
 this dominance has persisted since the early 1900s when a hierarchal system was created within radiology departments
 this effect created cultural norms that effectively limited the role of rts within the department
 this gap in professional identity and role has been compounded by the all too familiar just the radiographer syndrome leaving rts feeling intimidated worthless unappreciated and overlooked
 9 while healthcare professionals are deemed equally important with respect to the delivery of patient care woznitza hare and nair 10 recently emphasized that imaging departments provide uniquely vital support systems in the provision of care to patients during the covid-19 pandemic
 rts are front-line patient-care staff who play a key role in preserving an effectively operating medical imaging department
 11 in addition this profession is one of the most dangerous in frontline healthcare
 12 rts are trained health professionals who produce highquality medical images for radiologists and physicians
 as such rts are equally indispensable members of the healthcare team deserving of a distinct professional identity
 rts use critical thinking skills in the application of various imaging methods and procedures to assist physicians and other healthcare professionals in diagnosing andor monitoring a patients injury or illness
 13 in fact agadakos 11 asserted that basic imaging service like the chest ct is essential in assessing the early manifestation and progression of the covid-19 infection
clearly in a collaborative community approach all healthcare professions count and are equally essential in the war against the covid-19 pandemic
 the integral and pivotal role of rts cannot be underestimated
 the alliedness of this health care professional group is an evolving entity that cannot be overlooked
 the centrality of this silent yet important sector in the healthcare system invites the opening of avenues for interesting and meaningful colloquy and debates among scholars and research enthusiasts to unearth the dynamics of the professional identity of its members even after the pandemic
in conclusion the covid-19 pandemic has become an interesting lens to affirm the vital role that healthcare professionals play as a collaborative community
 though they are equally important in combatting the dangers of this health crisis this study underscores the silent and seemingly unrecognized space that rts occupy in the philippine healthcare system
 such space invites a closer examination on how professional identity as a dynamic phenomenon is developed as early as the university education and extends during the practice of the profession
 while the rt profession in the philippines is not as popular as the other allied-health disciplines like nursing pharmacy medical technology and rehabilitation sciences higher education institutions offering rt programs are challenged to institutionalise programs projects activities that would enable rt students to have a deeper understanding of self and the uniqueness of their field
 a good balance between technical skills acquisition and the development of a strong professional identity should be taken into consideration
 reflective exercises and opportunities to interact with other health professionals as early as university years could contribute to students professional identity development
 a programmatic research agenda that investigates the development of professional identity among future rts could be undertaken and be shared in professional gatherings to improve the delivery of the rt curriculum
while the philippine proclamation 194s
 of 1999 14 calls for the celebration of the national radiologic technology week that focuses public attention on the diagnostic and therapeutic uses of radiation the accompanying radiation hazard protection and the different modalities used in radiology the centrality and agency of the rts in the delivery of imaging services should not be overlooked
 today more than ever the important contributions of rts in the health care system in particular and in nation building in general implies the need to institutionalise a system of recognition through an excellence in rt practice award
 though professionals across disciplines are recognized through the yearly outstanding professional awards given by the philippine professional regulation commission the agency mandated to implement the regulatory laws and policies for the various regulated professions the award given by third-parties such as corporate foundations remains a blank spot in the field of rt
 for several years the outstanding contributions of teachers policemen soldiers journalists artists and firemen have already been recognized
 true enough the signaling function of these awards have afforded the public with heightened awareness and appreciation of the importance of these professionals in philippine society through media publicity
 also professional rt societies could spearhead the conduct of medical missions and other community extension services and engagements to increase the public presence of their members
 undoubtedly threading all efforts and initiatives from the university education to professional practice is a valuable way to strengthen the once neglected identity of rts in this part of the globe
  
 methods we conducted a prospective multicentre cohort study during the 200607 influenza season in berlin germany
 weekly mobile phone text messages were used to prompt participants to report respiratory illnesses during the influenza season
 a logistic regression model was used to assess the influence of potential risk factors
 results we recruited 250 hospital healthcare workers mean age 35
7 years and 486 non-healthcare workers mean age 39
2 years from administrative centres blood donors and colleges
 overall scii attack rate was 10
 being a healthcare worker was not a risk factor for scii relative risk 1
 the final multivariate model had three significant factors living with children odds ratio or 3

 living with three or more children or 13
01 was a greater risk than living with one or two children or 5
 30 of participants with scii reported no respiratory illness
 healthcare workers were at slightly higher risk of reporting any respiratory infection than controls adjusted or 1
 household contacts seem to be more important than exposure to patients
 car ownership is a surprise finding which needs further exploration
 asymptomatic infections are common accounting for around a third of serologically confirmed infections
 vaccination of hcws should theoretically reduce the risk of influenza infection both in themselves and their patients
 there is evidence to support the first reason for vaccination the protection of patients
 hcws can transmit influenza to those under their care during both outbreaks and non-outbreak situations 4 5 6 7 
 however not all serologically diagnosed influenza infections experience an influenza-like illness and a proportion will be asymptomatic
 hcws and some non-hcws were sought from the hospitals but only non-hcws were sought from all other sites
on recruitment before the influenza season consenting participants gave a single serum sample and completed an exposure questionnaire
 details recorded included age sex type of employment risk factors for influenza smoking status and vaccination status
 this strategy was employed in order to maximise the predictive value of a positive answer
after the influenza season participants were recalled by sms or email
 participants were asked to estimate the number of contacts made during a typical day in household and work settings
the primary outcome was evidence of scii by any of the above strains
 for the comparison of the exposure groups hcw vs
 non-hcw continuous variables were analysed using the kruskal-wallis test
 for the analysis of the association with scii continuous variables were explored by grouping them in categories
 we regarded a p-value of less than 0
 we then constructed a multivariate logistic regression model logistic command stata statacorp
 variables with p values between 0

 ethical approval for the study was obtained from the university of berlin faculty of medicine charité ethics committee
those not included in the study were of younger age 38 vs 34 p  0

 in 88486 18 the occupation was not stated or unclear
 table 1 compares study characteristics in the exposure group hcw and control group non-hcw
 hcws were significantly younger than controls 35
healthcare workers had significantly more non-patient contacts at work mean 14
021 but fewer contacts at home mean 2
01 there were no significant differences in immunisation in the previous three seasons or in household exposure to children
in total there were 82 titer rises among 78 participants
 there were four double-infections three with h3n2h1n1 coinfections and one with titre rises to both b strains

immunisation against influenza was associated with an or of 0
 vaccine effectiveness against scii was therefore 50 95ci 12-71
 effectiveness against scii with a reported ili was higher at 73 95ci 6-92 p  0
 other variables were added to the multivariate model but were found not to be significant at the p  0

054 were significant and the effect of smoking became statistically significant
05 and hcw status or 1
04 had an or above 1 and smoking had an or below 1 or 0
we found no significant association between being a healthcare worker in acute hospital care and serogically confirmed influenza infection
 instead we identified household contacts in particular children and car ownership as important risk factors for scii
we did not demonstrate a strongly increased risk of influenza infection in hcws in acute hospital care
 as hcws do appear to have an increased risk for ari or  1
3 it would be plausible to expect an effect of similar order for influenza infections
 lastly prior immunity may have played a role
 another study focusing on this hypothesis is needed to investigate it further
 we found a strong dose-response relationship for child household contacts
 adult household contacts may play a role analogous but possibly less marked to that of children
 this was unexpected as car ownership was only included as a counterpart question to public transport usage
 for this reason further details on passengers frequency or duration of car use were not obtained in the study
possession of a car has not previously been recognised as a risk factor for influenza acquisition
 car users are also exposed to air pollution from other vehicles and this may predispose users to respiratory infections
 both rail and air travel have been associated with respiratory infection transmission 22 23 
vaccine uptake was relatively high both in hcws 42 and non-hcws 32
 high vaccination uptake limited the number of scii and reduced the study power
 vaccination effectiveness was 50 against scii and reached 73 for a more severe outcome scii with reported ili
only 28 of participants with scii reported an ili the majority reporting no symptoms or more minor respiratory illness
 in addition only 26 of persons with an ili had evidence of an influenza infection
 thus the ili-syndrome was a poor marker for influenza infections
 conversely respiratory symptoms due to non-infectious causes may be over-reported in non-smokers
this study was subject to a number of limitations
we explored the possibility of influenza clustering due to site-level group influences or localized influenza outbreaks
 in addition the multilevel analysis suggested that there were no significant group-level influences on the outcome
 household contacts particularly children play an important role with individuals with three or more children being at highest risk
0004456994f6c1d5db7327990386d33c01cff32a  background influenza immunisation for healthcare workers is encouraged to protect their often vulnerable patients but also due to a perceived higher risk for influenza
 we aimed to compare the risk of influenza infection in healthcare workers in acute hospital care with that in non-healthcare workers over the same season
 methods we conducted a prospective multicentre cohort study during the 200607 influenza season in berlin germany
 recruited participants gave serum samples before and after the season and completed questionnaires to determine their relevant exposures and possible confounding factors
 the main outcome measure was serologically confirmed influenza infection scii defined as a fourfold or greater rise in haemagglutination inhibition antibody titres to a circulating strain of influenza with post-season titre at least 140
 weekly mobile phone text messages were used to prompt participants to report respiratory illnesses during the influenza season
 a logistic regression model was used to assess the influence of potential risk factors

our results suggest that healthcare workers in hospitals do not have a higher risk of influenza than non-healthcare workers although their risk of any respiratory infection is slightly raised
 household contacts seem to be more important than exposure to patients
 car ownership is a surprise finding which needs further exploration
 asymptomatic infections are common accounting for around a third of serologically confirmed infections
 the german standing commission for immunisation along with other authorities 1 2 3 currently recommends that healthcare workers hcws be vaccinated against seasonal influenza
 two reasons are cited firstly that hcws can be a source of infection for vulnerable people under their care 1 2 3  and secondly that hcws are at increased risk for contracting influenza 1 
 vaccination of hcws should theoretically reduce the risk of influenza infection both in themselves and their patients
 there is evidence to support the first reason for vaccination the protection of patients
 hcws can transmit influenza to those under their care during both outbreaks and non-outbreak situations 4 5 6 7 
 low vaccination rates in hcws have been associated with nosocomial outbreaks 4 8  and higher vaccination rates with reduced nosocomial influenza incidences 7 
hcws may transmit influenza to those under their care but is there evidence that their occupational exposures to patients relatives colleagues and the hospital environment confer an increased risk of influenza compared to the general population influenza serological attack rates in hcws of 23 single season 9  and 14 an average of two seasons 10  have been documented
 however as serological attack rates of influenza may vary considerably from season to season as well as from location to location without the inclusion of a comparison group of non-hcws neither study could demonstrate an increased risk
another aspect of influenza in hcws is that many hcws argue that they withdraw from work when they become ill with influenza-like illness to reduce their risk of transmitting influenza to their patients
 however not all serologically diagnosed influenza infections experience an influenza-like illness and a proportion will be asymptomatic
 the frequency of asymptomatic influenza infection in hcws has been assessed in volunteer studies 33 11  a cohort study 28 9  and one randomised controlled study 42 10 
the objective of this study was to address the question of whether hcws in the acute care hospital setting have a higher risk of serologically confirmed influenza infections scii than non-hcws and to assess the proportion of individuals with scii who experience either any respiratory symptoms or an influenza-like illness
we conducted our study in people living or working in berlin during the influenza season of 200607 using a multicentre prospective cohort design
there were 11 study sites three hospitals two administrative centres the robert koch institute and vivantes healthcare administrative centre four blood-donation centres and two colleges
 hcws and some non-hcws were sought from the hospitals but only non-hcws were sought from all other sites
we recruited participants through occupational health services in the hospitals and one administrative centre through direct recruitment at blood donation centres and through active recruitment during site visits at the other study sites non-healthcare workers from one administrative centre and two colleges
on recruitment before the influenza season consenting participants gave a single serum sample and completed an exposure questionnaire
 details recorded included age sex type of employment risk factors for influenza smoking status and vaccination status
 where participants had been vaccinated fewer than 14 days before the sample was taken or were found to have been vaccinated shortly after the initial sample was taken a second sample taken at least 14 days after vaccination was sought through direct recall or through occupational health
blood samples were refrigerated then transported within three days to the national reference laboratory for influenza at the robert koch institute in berlin where they were centrifuged and frozen
hcw in our context were defined as people working on a daily basis with unwell patients in an acute hospital setting including nurses trainee and qualified and doctors
 non-hcw were those working or studying at the study sites or attending the blood donation centres who did not fit the definition of hcw
exclusions applied to both hcws and non-hcws were people with patient contact in the community such as community doctors and nurses dentists and pharmacists people working in care homes laboratory workers who had contact with respiratory samples or with influenza virus people who planned to be away from berlin for more than two weeks during the projected season january to april and people who did not wish to be contacted weekly by mobile phone short message system sms or email
for the analysis of serologically-confirmed infections we excluded vaccinated individuals where the baseline serum sample was taken fewer than 14 days after vaccination or where a later second sample was not obtainable see recruitment above
 these participants were excluded from the serological analyses as any titre rise could have been caused by vaccination and not infection
because pigs can carry influenza viruses and participants with pig contact were associated with scii participants reporting contact with pigs were excluded
in order to document weekly occurrences of respiratory infections during the influenza season we contacted all participants weekly through sms or through email asking them if they had experienced a new respiratory infection during the previous 7 days
 where participants answered yes they were contacted by telephone and details of their infection were obtained using an illness questionnaire
weekly surveillance for respiratory infections covered the period from january 13 2007 to march 30 2007 a period chosen to coincide with the influenza season
 this strategy was employed in order to maximise the predictive value of a positive answer
after the influenza season participants were recalled by sms or email
 they gave a second serum sample and completed a further questionnaire including repeat questions on vaccination status and employment type number of patient contacts on a typical day between january 13 and april 6 2007 broad age classification of patient contacts adults 17 years and children 18 years clinical specialty and usage of facemasks for hcws daily professional and household contacts use of public transport and car ownership contact with pigs for veterinary students and vaccination in previous years
 participants were asked again if they had had respiratory infections over the period january 13 2007 to 6 th april 2007 extending the period of surveillance to one week after the last weekly sms was sent
contact was defined as either touching or having a two way conversation with someone close by or for patient contact only examining or giving care to a patient
 participants were asked to estimate the number of contacts made during a typical day in household and work settings
the paired blood samples were defrosted and antibody titres were determined on the same day using the haemagglutination inhibition test to determine infection in any of the two a subtypes or the two b lineages
 we tested for antibody to the following strains titres of below 10 were assigned the value of 5 in order to allow calculation of the titre rise
 scii was defined as a fourfold or greater titre rise between preand post-season samples with a postseason titre of at least 40
 as awisconsin672005 h3n2 and a california072004 h3n2 were closely related a titre rise to either of these strains was considered as a single scii due to ah3n2
the primary outcome was evidence of scii by any of the above strains
the clinical outcomes were influenza-like-illness ili defined as an illness with an acute onset self-reported fever cough and head or body pains and acute respiratory infection ari defined as any reported infection with coryza nasal discharge or cough
 clinical outcomes were based only on completed illness questionnaires or postseason illness reports not on sms or email replies the latter being used only as the prompt for collection of illness data
where illness was reported over more than one week symptoms for each week were combined to produce a single illness episode
 to produce an epidemic curve of scii with any ili or in its absence another ari the respective dates of illness onset were plotted
 where more than one illness episode was reported we used the onset date of the episode closest to the peak on the assumption that this episode was the most likely to be due to influenza virus
we undertook bivariate analyses for all binary exposure variables and calculated risk ratios rr their 95 confidence interval and p-values
 for the comparison of the exposure groups hcw vs
 non-hcw continuous variables were analysed using the kruskal-wallis test
 for the analysis of the association with scii continuous variables were explored by grouping them in categories
 we regarded a p-value of less than 0
05 as statistically significant
 we then constructed a multivariate logistic regression model logistic command stata statacorp

 figure 3 shows the distribution of dates of onset for all scii where an episode of ari or ili was reported
the peak seen in week 9 corresponded with the peak number of positive influenza tests from berlin patients performed at the national reference laboratory for influenza from patient samples collected through the german influenza sentinel surveillance system 12 
we found no significant association between being a healthcare worker in acute hospital care and serogically confirmed influenza infection
 instead we identified household contacts in particular children and car ownership as important risk factors for scii
 30 of participants with scii reported no symptoms and only around one-quarter of those reporting influenza-like illness also had scii
we did not demonstrate a strongly increased risk of influenza infection in hcws in acute hospital care
 as hcws do appear to have an increased risk for ari or  1
3 it would be plausible to expect an effect of similar order for influenza infections
 although study limitations might have led to a failure to detect a true increase it is unlikely that we have missed a large difference in the risk of influenza
 why might hcws in hospital not have a higher risk of influenza the prevalence of infectious influenza in patients may have been low either due to the absence of influenza patients or because patients admitted later in the course of illness might have been less infectious
 also infection control measures such as use of personal protective equipment and individual or cohort isolation might have reduced the risks of infection in hcws
 lastly prior immunity may have played a role
 hcws were less likely than non-hcws to be susceptible preseason titer of less than 40 to acalifornia072004 h3n2 which was the ah3n2 strain of the previous season and related to awisconsin672005 h3n2 the dominant strain in the 200607 season
as most influenza patients admitted to hospitals are children or older people one might expect to find an increased risk for scii in hcws who work with these patient groups
 our finding of an elevated odds ratio for hcws with more frequent contact with child patients albeit not significant in this setting would be consistent with this supposition
 another study focusing on this hypothesis is needed to investigate it further
household contacts and in particular children in the home were the main significant risk factors identified in table 4 logistic regression model for persons with serologically confirmed influenza infection as outcome n  727 exposurenumber figure 3 cases of serologically confirmed influenza infection reporting acute respiratory illness ari blue and influenza-like illness ili red by date of onset of reported illness n  53
 green line on secondary y-axis smoothed line of influenza cases in berlin identified at the national reference laboratory for influenza from samples collected within the german sentinel surveillance system 12 
this study
 this finding is similar to that in another droplet-transmitted infection meningitis where household contacts constitute by far the most important risk group 13 
 we found a strong dose-response relationship for child household contacts
 the role of children as the main sources of influenza transmission has been suggested in several studies 14 15 16 17 
 adult household contacts may play a role analogous but possibly less marked to that of children
 whilst public transport usage was not associated with scii car ownership was a significant risk factor albeit only in households without children
 this was unexpected as car ownership was only included as a counterpart question to public transport usage
 for this reason further details on passengers frequency or duration of car use were not obtained in the study
possession of a car has not previously been recognised as a risk factor for influenza acquisition
 however sharing a car does involve prolonged close contact in an enclosed space and has been linked to transmission of one airborne pathogen 18 
 in one observational study on risk factors for sars in china using a taxi more than once a week was identified as independent risk factor for sars infection with an increased odds ratio close to significance p  0
07
 furthermore this variable was kept in the multivariate model while riding a bus and taking the subway who were significant in bivariate analysis were not 19 
 ownership of a car may also be a marker for having a greater number of social contacts perhaps including children
 car users are also exposed to air pollution from other vehicles and this may predispose users to respiratory infections
 despite the unexpected nature of this finding it is possible that car usage is indeed a risk factor and should be explored through further studies
we did not find an increased risk of influenza in the 58 of participants who were regular users of public transport
 public transport usage has been cited as a possible risk factor for influenza infection particularly in the context of pandemic planning 20 
 in a recent international survey of precautionary behaviour for pandemic influenza 75 of respondents said that they would avoid public transport 21 
 both rail and air travel have been associated with respiratory infection transmission 22 23 
 whilst it is possible to contract influenza on public transport our results suggest that at least in berlin using public transport does not increase a persons risk of influenza
 in berlin crowding on public transport is infrequent and not extreme so this result may not be generalisable to cities with different conditions
vaccine uptake was relatively high both in hcws 42 and non-hcws 32
 reasons for this high hcw uptake include the participation of a hospital from former east germany where vaccination uptake in hospitals is still found to be higher than in west german hospitals
 in non-hcws the participation of a federal public health institute where influenza vaccination is freely offered to employees may account for the high vaccination rate
 high vaccination uptake limited the number of scii and reduced the study power
 vaccination effectiveness was 50 against scii and reached 73 for a more severe outcome scii with reported ili
only 28 of participants with scii reported an ili the majority reporting no symptoms or more minor respiratory illness
 the proportion of asymptomatic infections 30 or more was substantial and similar to that reported by elder 28 9 and consistent with an estimated proportion of 33 obtained from pooled challenge studies 10 
 in addition only 26 of persons with an ili had evidence of an influenza infection
 thus the ili-syndrome was a poor marker for influenza infections
 unvaccinated hcws who intend to withdraw from work when they become ill with influenza-typical symptoms may overlook many symptomatic or asymptomatic influenza infections putting patients at unnecessary risk
the association of hcw status and ari may reflect the fact that hcws communicate with or care for a large number of people including patients colleagues and relatives and are thus exposed to a wide variety of respiratory pathogens
 the reduced risk for ari in people aged over 50 years might be explained by their cumulative immune experience or a lower contact rate
 the apparent protective effect of smoking could be due to lower ascertainment of ari in this group where a background of smoking-related symptoms may have masked the onset of an additional mild infectious respiratory illness
 conversely respiratory symptoms due to non-infectious causes may be over-reported in non-smokers
what significance does this study have for the current h1n1v pandemic as pandemic influenza should result in a higher attack rate than seasonal influenza the prevalence of influenza in hospital inpatients and staff is likely to be higher than for seasonal influenza so increasing the risk of exposure and infection for hcws compared to that described here
 for the same reasons the risk in hcws and non-hcws from their household contacts would also be higher than for seasonal influenza
 therefore even if a repeat study during pandemic conditions identified a significant occupational risk for hcws household exposures might still be more strongly associated with influenza infection
this study was subject to a number of limitations
 as recruiting at the hospital and one administrative study site was done through the occupational health departments only a small proportion fewer than 10 of the hcws at these sites were enrolled in the study
 selection bias could have concealed any actual relationship between hcws status and influenza infection if hcws with a lower risk of influenza than their non-recruited colleagues were to have enrolled or if non-hcws with a higher risk of influenza enrolled
 it is possible that hcws with a higher number of patient contacts and therefore in theory a higher risk of influenza would be less likely to participate due to pressure of work
 alternatively hcws who were concerned about their higher risk of influenza may have protected themselves better and may have been more likely than other hcws to participate which would tend to decrease the relative risk in this group
loss of recruited participants mostly due to losses to follow up despite repeated attempts to contact and to the timing of vaccination reduced the effective power of the study and may have worsened selection bias although excluded participants did not differ significantly with respect to variables found to influence the outcome
although there were differences between the two comparison groups with respect to sex recent immunisation smoking and use of public transport the logistic regression methods should have adjusted for these where they had an effect on the outcome in particular immunisation
 the lower average age and higher proportion of females in the hcw group is likely to be due to recruitment among trainee nurses in the larger hospitals
serological testing for influenza infection alone rather than molecular testing methods may have underestimated the true number of influenza infections 24 
 this along with the relatively high vaccination uptake will have reduced the number of scii and thus the effective study power
 with an attack rate of 10 in non-healthcare workers the sample size of 736 analysed would not have been sufficient to detect a relative risk below 1
8 80 power 5 significance
we explored the possibility of influenza clustering due to site-level group influences or localized influenza outbreaks
 analysis of symptom onset dates revealed no evidence of separate site-specific outbreaks but instead the epidemic curves at each study site followed the overall trend
 in addition the multilevel analysis suggested that there were no significant group-level influences on the outcome
our study results suggest that hcws in an acute hospital care setting are at no higher risk of influenza than the general public or that if they are the increased risk is modest
 household contacts particularly children play an important role with individuals with three or more children being at highest risk
 use of public transport does not increase the risk of influenza whereas in the absence of household children car ownership does seem to significantly increase the risk for influenza infection although the mechanism is unclear
 further research would help to clarify the role of household contacts of different age groups the relevance of car ownership and whether subgroups of hospital hcwsor hcws in other settings such as in primary careare at increased risk for influenza infection
 finally the ili-syndrome is a poor marker for influenza infection suggesting that hcws cannot rely on this syndrome if they wish to confidently protect their patients but should instead be vaccinated
 
 one such debate is whether risk is socially constructed
 the rationalist approach puts emphasis on scientific management statistics and decision theory in order to control risk
 the proximity of residential areas to hazardous industrial ones has become increasingly important due to urban growth
 the above is a general statement attempting to express the common beliefs of the population
 the characteristics of potential dangers associated with a risk also heavily influences risk perception
 people tend to believe that rare sensational events pose a higher level of risk than more conventional events
some risk analysts regard perception as invalid because they arise from subjective influences
1 smith 2004 analyses differences between risk assessment and risk perception
 • probabilistic perception people having probabilistic perception accept that natural hazards exist and they maybe random events
 therefore they do not see any benefit in doing anything about something that is an act of god
 risks are taken more seriously if they are understood by people as life-threatening immediate and direct
 risk is also perceived to be higher if children are at risk in comparison with seniors

 a number of them also proposed online courses as they are convenient
 in particular it has been suggested that they insufficiently incorporate local concerns authority culture and expertise
 community based models that encourage such interactions can often be more effective
it is not surprising that command and control was emphasized more in the response phase
 during crisis situations such approaches are far more challenging
 one of the most notable features of fig

19 hindrances to disaster and emergency management nirupama and etkin 2012 
 in general the survey respondents feel that people who survive a disaster display pro-social behaviour in the immediate aftermath
 this group felt that only solicited aid is useful as uncoordinated supplies are often a hindrance
 one noted that if relief is to be sent it should be specific to the needs of the people
to summarize emergency managers felt that priority of the institution should be to mitigate impact on people and assets
 they acknowledged that not enough time is allotted to fill gaps and consequently occasionally same mistakes are repeated
 disaster scenario simulations reveal that there are greater interdependencies than anticipated

 so if there is no singular definition of risk how can it be comprehended to begin one must become exposed to the debates that surround the controversial term
 one such debate is whether risk is socially constructed
 is it objective and measureable or subjective and immeasurable and to what degree to clarify the objective perspective is referred to as the rationalist approach and the subjective perspective is referred to as the constructionist approach etkin 2016
 the rationalist approach puts emphasis on scientific management statistics and decision theory in order to control risk
 the constructionist approach suggests that nothing is a risk in itself but rather that it is a product of cultural political social and historical ways of seeing
 the above-mentioned debate is one of major standing in the field of risk however risk does in fact reflect upon both perspectives
 if risk is socially constructed society has made decisions which have inadvertently determined who is at risk and what the risks are
 there are several factors contributing to socially constructed risk such as minorities education disability elderly and children poverty and health pine 2009 
 a well-developed example of a socially constructed risk faced by many in urbanized areas has been provided by etkin 2016 in the quoteallowing housing construction near hazardous chemical plants is a socialpolitical decision that puts people who live there in harms way
 the proximity of residential areas to hazardous industrial ones has become increasingly important due to urban growth
when a person is exposed to a risk they do not respond to that risk directly rather they respond to their own perception of that risk
 generally speaking the average person non-expert relies on intuition to assess a risk this concept is referred to as risk perception
 within social groups acting powers downplay certain risks and emphasize others as a means of maintaining and controlling the group slovic 1987 
 a common perception found within many industrialized nations is the belief that people are presently exposed to a higher degree of risk than traditionally faced in the past and risks to be faced in the future will be larger than present risk schneider et al
 2006 etkin and haque 2003 
 the above is a general statement attempting to express the common beliefs of the population
 there is however two viewpoints of risk not mentioned in the above-mentioned common perception lay judgment of risk and expert judgement of risk
 lay judgement is generally a rights-based approach that focuses on justice uncertainty who benefits from the risk who is at risk and dread
 it is important to note that expert judgement is prone to the same biases as laypeople especially if the experts are forced to go beyond the limits of available data and rely on intuition slovic 1987 
 with that being said members of the public sometimes do not possess all of the information relating to a certain hazard and therefore can be misinformed
 it is beneficial to embrace both the public and expert viewpoints in order to develop a well-rounded grasp on risk as both views offer unique intelligence and insight in hébert 2016 
research suggests that one of the greatest influences on risk perception is cultural factors causing a distortion of perception that can travel between social groups potentially distorting the actualrealistic threats
 risk perception is fueled by peoples experiences or lack-of emotions and social and cultural factors of the community along with numerous influencers
 each individual experiences and perceives risk differently and therefore makes it difficult to truly define the concept gierlach et al
 2010 isdr 2004 gtz 2004 
 risk perception is influenced by direct or indirect experiences of activities events andor technologies for example receiving information from news sources or witnessing a natural disaster such as a severe flood
 the characteristics of potential dangers associated with a risk also heavily influences risk perception
 people tend to believe that rare sensational events pose a higher level of risk than more conventional events
 peoples judgements of risk stem from social learning peer influences and cultural practices and are continuously exposed to media reports and other processes of communication
 similar to risk risk perception is viewed differently by each individual depending on the following factors the type of risk the context of the risk the social context and the individuals personality
 an individuals perception of risk is a motivator urging community members to spring in to action mitigate avoid and adapt to risks wachinger et al
 2013 
some risk analysts regard perception as invalid because they arise from subjective influences
 but to the general public perception are the only relevant views because they incorporate the experts analysis together with individual judgement based on individual experience social context and other factors
 the public also suspects that limits exist to what experts know a suspicion that is justified in certain cases sjöberg 2001 
 table 5 
1 smith 2004 analyses differences between risk assessment and risk perception
lay people perceive hazards differently from technical experts for a variety of reasons including geographical location and aspects of their personality
 for example rural dwellers often perceive flood hazard perception closer to objectively derived estimates than urban dwellers smith 2004 nirupama and simonovic 2007 nirupama et al
 2014 
 group perceptions can easily be influenced by social or cultural factors as the influence of personality is exercised mainly through the so-called locus of control
 this classifies people according to the extent that they believe hazardous events are dependent on fate external control or within their own responsibility internal control
 in order to reduce the stress associated with uncertainty hazard perceivers tend to adopt certain recognizable models of risk perception with which they are more comfortable
 these can be grouped into three basic types all of which conflict with more objective risk analysis smith 2004 • determinate perception people having determinate perception believe that extreme events such as earthquakes and flash flooding do exist but they occur in a certain pattern
 • dissonant perception people having dissonant perception believe that natural hazards are freak events that are unlikely to be repeated
 • probabilistic perception people having probabilistic perception accept that natural hazards exist and they maybe random events
 therefore they do not see any benefit in doing anything about something that is an act of god
 if decision makers responsible for disaster mitigation happen to hold probabilistic perception they may not support investing of resources in mitigation measures
social amplification of risk occurs when relatively minor threats elicit a disproportionately strong degree of public concern as demonstrated in table 5
 2 kasperson et al
 1988 
 risks are taken more seriously if they are understood by people as life-threatening immediate and direct
 this means that an earthquake a rapid onset event is normally rated more seriously than a drought a slow onset hazard
 risk is also perceived to be higher if children are at risk in comparison with seniors
 additionally lack of understanding of complex technologies associated with factories and chemical industries in the vicinity leads to fear and distrust in technical experts and the authorities
 currently ongoing environmental and climate adapted from whyte and burton 1982  smith 2004 change concerns are perceived differently by younger generation than older people whose priorities tend to be around health and safety issues fischer et al
 1991 
 awareness is heightened when public health is at stake
 for example the city of flint michigan is facing in the worst public health crisis seen to date in the united states
 with flints struggling economy in 2014 the local government officials made a decision to switch the water from being supplied by lake huron and pre-treated in detroit to be supplied by the flint river without adding in the anticorrosive agent in order to save the city money
 the decision to not add in the anticorrosive agent would cascade in to a major health disaster as entire region was exposed to lead poisoning as well as exposure to legionella bacteria for 18 months
 the health effects this water crisis caused flint was unimaginable to the community
 the people were unaware that there was lead in the water that could be absorbed through the skin as well as being ingested flint task force 2016
 the community was starting to see the side effects of the water in forms of rashes eye irritations and behavioural changes gupta et al

 people are also extremely fearful of nuclear accidents and nuclear power plants and have a great deal of skepticism in the industry
 the world has seen accidents such as the three miles island in 1979 chernobyl in 1986 and recently fukushima meltdown in japan in 2011
 the three mile island unit 2 tmi-2 reactor near middletown pennsylvania usa partially melted down on march 28 1979

 hydrogen was released from the reactor pressure vessels leading to explosions inside the reactor buildings in units 1 3 and 4 that damaged structures and equipment and injured personnel
 radionuclides were released from the plant to the atmosphere and were deposited on land and on the ocean
 there were also direct releases into the sea
 people within a radius of 20 km of the site and in other designated areas were evacuated and those within a radius of 20-30 km were instructed to shelter before later being advised to voluntarily evacuate
 restrictions were placed on the distribution and consumption of food and the consumption of drinking water

the media has a fascination with disastrous events influencing and inflating public anxiety and perceptions of danger borum et al
 2010 
 when events such as school or college shootings occur public fear is heightened due to the fact that schools are portrayed as a safe place for children lindle 2008 
 like the general public teachers hear about school shootings occurring exacerbating their existing fear of violence against children
 similarly wildforest fires that have potential to engulf communities and explosions caused by various reasons with a potential to hurt communities receive much and prolonged attention by the media
 people are generally fearful of fires due to their destructive nature and stomach turning reaction to burn injuries or death
 they provoke extreme passion in peoples minds
 there are also advantages to media attention in that it creates awareness emotional engagement and encourages donations and other forms of help by local national and international community
 a recent example of a forest fire is fort mcmurray alberta fires in may 2016

be vulnerability is degree of loss from 0 to 100 resulting from a potential damaging phenomenon
 the public safety canada psc 2012 describes vulnerability as a condition or set of conditions determined by physical social economic and environmental factors or processes that increases the susceptibility of a community to the impact of hazards
also defined in the psc 2012 report is the vulnerability assessment as the process of identifying and evaluating vulnerabilities describing all protective measures in place to reduce them and estimating the likelihood of consequences

 many times vulnerable people living in hazard-prone areas do not perceive their exposure to risk concerning enough to becoming their top priority nirupama 2015 as basic necessities of life remains their main focus
 perception about peoples behaviour during emergencies defines to a large extent how authorities would plan resource allocation for community emergency response as well as develop and implement mitigation measures
 during the past decade a paradigm shift in the approach to disaster management has been apparent and community participation is being encouraged by policy makers
 it is believed that community participation not a top-down approach will bring about a comprehensive and accurate appreciation of peoples perception regarding hazard risk vulnerability and resilience
 experts wisner et al
 2004 ferrier and haque 2003 twigg 2007 unisdr 2001 have also delved in explaining the progression of peoples vulnerability by employing various arguments given the social physical and political environments
 birkmann 2006 has developed indicators for identifying and assessing vulnerability
 emphasis on assessing peoples vulnerability and potential risks they may be exposed to in order to mitigate losses through knowledge based actions is clearly noticeable cutter 2012 icsu 2008 pelling 2003 jaeger et al

 according to the 2006 census statistics canada 2008 toronto is one of the only four census divisions where more than 16 new immigrants 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 fall in the low income category -5 higher than the national average
 ontario is the largest population centre ten of the top twenty-five most populous canadian municipalities are in ontario toronto being number one at more than 2
5 million
 ontario is home to more than half of canadas visible minorities out of which more than 30 reside in the gta while the national average is only 16

 though two-thirds of torontos adult population has completed postsecondary education the percentage of allophones persons whose first language is neither english nor french is as high as 86 in several prominent municipalities
 employment numbers are discouraging and newer dwellings are built further away from places of workan additional contributing factor in the progression of vulnerability
 in this scenario it is prudent to pay attention to how vulnerabilities are perceived by policy makers with regards to emergency management and how they might impact potential disasters mileti 1999 mitchell 2003 tierney 2007 
 two studies are discussed in this section to illustrate the role and importance of peoples perception of risk and vulnerability
 the first study nirupama and maula 2013 is based on a focus group session conducted at the south asian womens centre sawc in toronto canada fig

 the participant women in the group were regular members of the centre using the resource because they were vulnerable in more than one way
 they were mainly over 40 years old the majority with little education unemployed facing language barriers low income group and reliant on public transit
 many participants identified that they lived in the vicinity of rivers lakes railways or power plants fig

11 is an example that participants did not understand what was meant by level of safety exposure to risk and sense of belonging in their community as most of them chose not to respond to the question

the second study was carried out in the region of peel in the gta fig

 the region of peel has a regional emergency management rem program in place
 a survey conducted by the rem highlighted that among immigrants and visible minorities presence of fire safety devices and other precautionary measures are less common and there is a lack of social support for emergency situations
 this research is based on the premise set by the rem survey to further explore peoples knowledge preferences interests priorities and perceptions in order to identify strengths and weaknesses in the society
 a questionnaire based survey was used to collect data from three different community locations in the city of brampton namely south fletchers sportsplex 
 the questionnaire consisted of 29 questions intended to gather information from a sample of entities for the purpose of constructing attributes of the larger population of which the entities are members

it is apparent from the responses in the two case studies that to a certain degree people understand the importance of social network but they do not see a need to there is also a lack of awareness and understanding in regards with what is meant by potential risk as a number of responses were other not applicable or no response
 peoples perception on issues concerning assessment of their vulnerability in the context of their society must be observed after disseminating sufficient knowledge in addition to making efforts to attract their attention to the importance of such issues
 particularly with an emphasis on how cultural myths and false beliefs affect decision-making various authors have discussed barriers to good disaster management e
g
 der heide 1989 alexander 2002
 these include post-disaster recreation of vulnerability removal of natural protective barriers failure to learn from the mistakes of others failure to correct existing but known deficiencies overdependence upon technology lack of recognition of system problems the inter-governmental paradox institutional ambiguities apathy underestimation of risk overestimation of capacity lack of resources cultural attitudes such as fatalism defeatism etc
 social pressures opposing special interest groups and reliance upon mythsfalse beliefs in disaster planning response and management
 research in the nascent field of disaster management suggests that it is often ineffective because of a large number of reasons
 how the professional emergency management community perceives barriers that hinder effective emergency management and views itself may provide useful insights and suggest strategies that might be used to help develop a culture of safety nirupama and etkin 2009 
the way many disasters unfold can be attributed in part to a lack of institutional preparedness and a general perception of risk whyte and burton 1982 slovic 2000 white et al
 2001 alexander 2002 twigg 2007 olanubi 2009 
 to better understand this issue nirupama and etkin 2012 conducted a study to obtain insights into the minds and thoughts of emergency management professionals in ontario canada
 in order to assess how emergency management institutions perceive their importance in terms of canadian society and the emergency management community the authors interviewed a number of experts positioned in policy-making and decision-making capacities
 based on these interviews a questionnaire was prepared that highlighted some major concerns such as disaster mythsfalse beliefs institutional barriers knowledge limitations cultural barriers and resource limitations
 in total nine experts three per sector in emergency management were interviewed from a the public b the private and c non-profit sectors in order to ascertain their opinions and perspectives on cultural and other barriers to risk reduction
 specific agencies targeted include a emergency management ontario public safety canada and health canada b bank of montreal ibm and ontario hydro and c red cross salvation army and canadian centre for emergency preparedness
 the interviews were semi-structured with open-ended questions to elicit rich details on the barriers to emergency management in canada
 further the open-ended format minimized the influence of researchers biases on the issue
 these interviews were taped and anonymous
 post interview analysis highlighted the attitudes and perceptions of the interviewees with respect to themselves their own organizations their role in emergency management in canada and their clients
the questionnaire that was prepared based on these expert interviews was employed to conduct an anonymous survey of approximately 70 emergency managers in ontario with the assistance of the ontario association of emergency managers which is the provincial professional organization for emergency managers
 twenty-four or 34 of the surveyed people replied
generally speaking respondents scored emergency management institutions as having an average performance with the exception of their own which they tended to rate as significantly higher than others
 most of them asserted that the amount of education and training they had received in their field was good or very good
 this might not necessarily reflect a disinterest in improving job performance
 the half of the respondents that were undecided might hesitate due to other concerns such as being at the twilight of their career potential costs or the difficulty of balancing further education with career and family
 one respondent felt that it is better to use proven procedures and techniques rather than pursuing new creative ways of doing things
 for those that wanted further educationtraining ims incident management system was the training identified most as being needed
 on deciding whether or not to take further education or training two-thirds of the respondents said they would prefer short courses
 a number of them also proposed online courses as they are convenient
emergency managers views were sought regarding whether a command  control hierarchical model would be preferred over a community-based one fig
 5
18 
 the question was in the context of the four phases of the emergency management cycle namely mitigation and prevention preparedness response and recovery
 this question was placed within the following context two different models of emergency and disaster management are a one that is top down command  control and b another that is community based
 hierarchical command and control models based upon a pyramidal authority structure have been criticized as not being the most effective for handling complex disasters
 in particular it has been suggested that they insufficiently incorporate local concerns authority culture and expertise
 community based models that encourage such interactions can often be more effective
 from an alternate perspective president bush after hurricane katrina said it is now clear that a challenge on this scale requires greater federal authority and a broader role for the armed forces
 
 
it is not surprising that command and control was emphasized more in the response phase
 it is much easier to implement community based approaches during normal day-to-day non-emergency operations where there are few time constraints and decisions are not urgent
 during crisis situations such approaches are far more challenging
 what is surprising is that so many preferred a command and control approach during the mitigation and prevention phases in the personal experience of the authors emergency managers often prefer community engagement in this part of the cycle
 one of the most notable features of fig
 5 
18 is a large variance in terms of how the respondents viewed command-and-control versus community-based approaches
 recent academic literature has emphasized problems with top-down management structures and emphasized the importance of including community involvement e
g
 mileti 1999 canton 2007 
 in part this may reflect a tendency for emergency managers to come from military or first responder backgrounds where this approach works well and is the basis for much of their training and work
information sharing came up as an important component of em as can be seen in the select four quotes from the comments section of the survey as given belowhow can you expect members of the community to become involved if they arent aware of the risks they faceagencies and jurisdictions are dependent upon one another and all elements of the community are dependent upon a number of critical infrastructure sectorsorganizations
 time and again at tabletop exercises participants discover that there are greater interdependencies nirupama and etkin 2012 than they had previously anticipated
 more robust and systemic information sharing would minimize this kind of surprise and often these moments of oh we didnt know that are the most useful outcomes of multi-party and multi-sector exercises
emergency events dont respect geographical boundariesneither planning nor response should be done in a vacuum
public has a right to know and to be informed
 public is responsible for themselves and must educate and prepare accordingly
 i believe is promotes resiliency
on the contrary few but striking arguments were presented against information sharingrestricting the information received on a communitys vulnerabilities would be in our best interest
encouraging information sharing can be a difficult proposition to sell because i have noticed that the general perception is that sharing the results of a hira would point out where all the vulnerabilities are
 that is true to an extent but that neglects the unknown vulnerabilities that arise from not knowing how our partner agencies jurisdictions and critical sectors rely on us and on one another
 the general thinking is still that each agency and jurisdiction looks out for itself particularly at the senior management levels in my opinion and there is little focus on the overall coordinated em and disaster response effort
 there is information sharing to be sure often at multi-party exercises
 it is just that i think there needs to be more and it needs to be integrated into our processes and the way we think about the how and why of information sharing
 figure 5 
19 illustrates the responses concerning possible hindrances to effective and efficient emergency and disaster management
 even though 79 of the responses blame insufficient funds some noted that effective programs and policies are also necessary that would make emergency management a greater part of canadian culture
 a large number 75 also thought political factors are a major barrier to emergency and disaster management
 many felt that there is a lot of politicking when it comes to emergency management thus action is not taken until forced the 2003 sars crisis was given as an example
 by politicking we refer to the need to engage in the political process to obtain resources conflicts between fig

19 hindrances to disaster and emergency management nirupama and etkin 2012 
 the question was designed to seek more than one response from respondents suggesting their preference which is why the total percentage of all categories combined is more than one hundred percent various organizations and difficulties in convincing decision makers to invest in emergency management during non-emergency periods
 some expressed the opinion that politicians do not take em seriously because they do not see how it would translate into votes
while few professionals expressed concern that the institution is too bureaucratic and too slow to react others wanted to see more advertising and awareness campaigns being initiated
 regarding the federal initiative national disaster mitigation strategy it was felt that the document despite being great lacked a costbenefit analysis and support for mitigation measures and instead focussed on the costs of response and recovery
 furthermore not so optimistic comments were also found in the interviews suggesting that there is a lack of familiarity with the mitigation strategy and that governments simply legislate and make more rules without actually implementing much
based upon the set of disaster myths listed in alexander 2002 see appendix 4 for reality the following statements were made with which the practitioner was asked for their level of agreement 1 ¼ agree and 10 ¼ disagree• after a disaster survivors tend to be dazed and apathetic half the respondents did not disagree with the claim that disaster survivors are dazed and apathetic though some noted that it depends on the type of disaster
 • looting is a common and serious problem after disasters 46 agree that looting is a common problem after disasters
 • disasters give rise to spontaneous displays of antisocial behavior fifty eight percent disagree with the assumption that disasters give rise to spontaneous displays of antisocial behaviour
 in general the survey respondents feel that people who survive a disaster display pro-social behaviour in the immediate aftermath
 • any kind of aid and relief is useful after disaster provided that it is supplied quickly enough fifty four percent of the respondents said that not all aid or relief is useful after a disaster
 this group felt that only solicited aid is useful as uncoordinated supplies are often a hindrance
 one noted that if relief is to be sent it should be specific to the needs of the people
 another good point was that if the aid required a substantial amount of resources to manage it would be more of a hindrance than a help as em teams might be put to better use the resources elsewhere
 • people will flee in large numbers from a disaster thirty four percent of respondents were confident that people tend to flee
the responses on disaster myths suggest a positive bias since a large proportion of the emergency managers subscribed to common disaster myths
 this is a well known phenomenonwhere people tend to view themselves and the world in a considerably more positive light than is objectively justified bazerman and watkins 2004 
 this result is similar to the findings of fischer 1998 who found that the frequency of belief in myths by emergency managers was independent of years in the job or experience but only depended upon level of education
to summarize emergency managers felt that priority of the institution should be to mitigate impact on people and assets
 they acknowledged that not enough time is allotted to fill gaps and consequently occasionally same mistakes are repeated
 disaster scenario simulations reveal that there are greater interdependencies than anticipated
 the role of hazard identification and risk assessment at the provincial level was felt vital
 it was recognized that risk and vulnerability assessment and prioritization is pivotal for making connections with disaster mitigation strategies and resource allocation
 in accordance with what etkin 1999 presented regarding risk transference and related trends we notice that the process of risk assessment lies more within the jurisdiction of municipalities and cities than at higher levels of government

000525b51f78000644865b63d47ac27c624c5981   today the term pandemic is both a metaphor for a global process and a specific instance of that process
 the process in question is a distorted form of development whose expression in neoliberalism has produced in pandemic fashion colossal but highly concentrated wealth enormous inequality and vast environmental destruction with profound implications for the construction of risk to natural and anthropogenic hazards globally dickinson and burton 2015 
 the specific instance is the covid-19 pandemic a global disaster the scale of which transcends ecological regions national borders economies and societies overwhelming their specific capacities to address disruption of societal functions
 the current toll in total cases exceeds 28 million cases 900000 deaths jhu as of this writing and could cost the global gdp up to 82 trillion over five years centre for risk studies 2020
the pandemic lays bare the interdependence complexity and inequality created by the global system linked in driving the catastrophe
 with the increasing globalization of trade and migration the intensification of linkages is also driving a globalization of biophysical phenomena that is creating problems including disasters across scales in space and in time holling 1994 
 as such in addition to its epidemiology we argue here that the covid-19 pandemic should be analyzed holistically as a disaster
although disasters traditionally were depicted as sudden unpredictable events acts of nature fate or some divine power since the 1980s disasters have come to be understood not as oneoff events but rather as socially constructed processes unfolding over time intimately related to ongoing social processes often associated with misinformed development wisner et al
 2004 
 disaster triggering events obviously differ but analogous approaches to development privileging economic growth over social and environmental values and priorities are key factors in their occurrence
 as in all disasters the pandemic represents the materialization of underlying risk conditions
 in that context disasters in general now constitute a pandemic j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f because a global population is facing a set of similar social and economic processes that coupled with systemic environmental hazards generate disasters
understanding the covid 19 pandemic as a disaster establishes relevance for policies for managing the multifaceted dimensions of risk
 this understanding requires a transdisciplinary and integrated perspective based on the proposition that the causes of any problem must be addressed in order to develop effective solutions
 such a forensic approach seeks to identify the root causes that energize the risk drivers that are ultimately expressed in conditions of vulnerability and exposure
 wisner et al 2004 burton 2010 burton  2015 oliver-smith et al
 2016  2017 
a forensic approach frames hazard exposure and vulnerability as the central components of disaster risk
 derived from long-term historical and contemporary social economic cultural political environmental and institutional processes disaster risk and disasters are directly linked to power structures and political and economic systems blaikie et al
1994 wisner et al
 2004 
 the risk associated with the pandemic has accumulated through the concatenation of a range of processes within and across territorial and governance scales
the virus is not in itself a hazard until it encounters an exposed and vulnerable population
due to the rapid exposure to the virus however and inadequate initial responses in many national contexts covid-19 poses a risk that is extensive global and transnational in character
 moreover the pandemic has characteristics of sequential and cascading risk of mortality and morbidity overwhelming stress on public health systems and widespread interruption of economic activity and social services
exposure to covid-19 is mediated through the structure of the global economic system
 the degree and nature of integration of countries and their cities into the global economy modulate flows of people and therefore of contagion primarily but not exclusively through air travel
 the populations of metropolitan cities like new york or london likely suffered greater exposure because they live in key nodes in the global economy at high density levels lavell et al
 2020 
 by virtue of their strategic importance greater connectivity was stimulated by the development of global markets
 however that connectivity is also characterized by social inequalities that skew development towards some and away from j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f others
 in addition international travel voluntary and involuntary human displacements including those of refugees migration patterns and population hubs effectively involve a notion of places as coupled in which those social interactions construct greater exposure newland 2020 
exposure is also configured by the organization of territory urban space and land use
 when people live crowded in small housing units in multi-family buildings in dense urban slums and informal settlements serviced mostly by public transport social distancing becomes next to impossible
 occupations such as service workers in general and many in informal sector activities involve close contact with the public has imposed greater risk on specific populations in a pandemic
 in the united states for example the exposure of african americans through their occupations in lower paid service jobs is underscored by fatality rates well beyond their representation in the total population apm research lab 2020
cultural and social interactional forms and patterns also may modify exposure and may also support or undermine policies such as social distancing
 governments in turn have in some cases shown themselves to be unwilling to institute strategies that run counter to specific ideological frames and local cultural norms
as is well known disaster risk is also shaped by the vulnerability of individuals and social groups
 in the covid 19 pandemic everyone is susceptible to the virus but not everyone is vulnerable in the same way or to the same degree
 some aspects of susceptibility in the pandemic are related to genetics aging and morbidity but can be exacerbated by socially constructed conditions such as malnutrition addiction and poverty which are dimensions of vulnerability rooted in processes such as corruption inequality lack of access to services such as healthcare sanitation and education due to public and private sector funding policies and development priorities
 while these factors may combine with pre-existing conditions particularly among the elderly exposure to the hazard may increase in low income nations of the south with younger populations due to poverty and related health conditions thus also increasing the pandemics impact
the massive response to covid-19 can be explained at least in its first wave because the pandemic has affected principally those nations that play powerful roles in the world economy
 it is arguable that the political and economic imperative to manage the covid-19 pandemic arises from the priorities of critical nodes in the world economy and its value chains lavell et al
 2020 
 thus far there have been two main types of risk management j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f policies
 policies have been implemented with varying degrees of success or failure primarily to address the risks of morbidity and mortality through forms of epidemiological control policies of confinement social distancing mask wearing and through strengthening public health services to avoid system collapse
 a second type of risk management policies launched by many governments and regional and multilateral organizations basically aims at ameliorating the economic impacts of the first set of strategies and include fiscal and monetary measures to mitigate the impact of health risk management actions
 deferral of tax payments partial payment of salaries and injection of liquidity into financial systems have also been used to diminish the impact of lost revenues on both the population and the economic system
 while unquestionably effective in staving off the most acute economic impacts for impacted populations the political viability of such options has placed the necessary continuation of many of these strategies in doubt as the pandemic progresses into subsequent phases
since health care is a universal human right ghebreyesus 2017  the dilemma at the most basic level is how to reconcile these two sets of policies without diminishing the effectiveness of either such as it is so far
 this tension is further complicated by the fact that morbidity and mortality are experienced locally but the economic impacts are also national and global
moreover both sets of policies obviously bring with them their own sets of risks that are experienced differently in each country and within different social groups
 the economic and social risks of prolonged confinement are likely to be much greater for informal workers migrants and homeless people amongst others who lack space to work remotely and care for children at home
 for these sectors it is possible that reducing the risk of infection from covid-19 ends up creating more risk than does ignoring recommendations for confinement to ensure income and daily sustenance
from this perspective the supposedly neutral and technocratic management of risk to lives health systems and the economy foregrounds the conflict between a health care system designed to heal and an economic system that considers monetary loss as the greater danger
hardly concealed is a transfer of risks from those social and economic sectors that will most benefit from flattening the curve and economic reactivation to those who will face more risks and receive fewer benefits
 however the huge operational dilemma between addressing the mortality and morbidity from covid-19 and the ensuing massive social and economic loss and damage from economic slowdown need to be unpacked carefully and shown to be a false j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f choice
 without a healthy producing and consuming population there will be little economic recovery
the ongoing disaster cannot be explained by a virus per se but rather as a consequence of preexisting risk conditions and management policies
 disasters generally reveal that without reducing inequality poverty and exclusion those most affected will see their risk increase von braun et al
 2020 
 the covid 19 pandemic demonstrates this point at a global level
in that context transforming the underlying risk factors is a global challenge
 there is a tension that all post disaster reconstruction efforts face between reinstalling the flawed prior system and addressing its endemic problems that created the disaster in the first place
specifically should public intervention aim to restore the same economic model that consistently prioritizes short term gain over long term human and environmental security or rather direct efforts toward transforming the model toward reducing future risk and addressing social inequalities exposed by the pandemic and other types of disaster and crisissuch a transformation means seriously addressing and eliminating current inadequacies of governance the economic system global inequities in economic social racial cultural gender and other domains protection and preservation of the global environment security displacement of populations and others
 the magnitude of addressing these root or underlying causes is enormous and the challenge of coming to grips with such endemic conditions deeply embedded and entrained in and through national and international systems is daunting to say the least
yet perhaps there is hope to be found in some of the initial responses to the emergence of the covid 19 virus and pandemic
 the pandemic has revealed that what was normal is the source of vulnerability and exposure thus requiring policies to enact the necessary transformational responses to health climate and other disaster risks now
 the early stages of the pandemic also showed that financial resources can be made available at a level thought impossible as little as six months ago
 it has also revealed that a significant political will normally conspicuously absent in dealing with other global issues can be mobilized to address a global crisis
 and it has shown that strong and effective measures to reduce contagion risk can be made where social institutions and political structures are competent well organized and supported
 the longer term durability of such measures however is absolutely essential for success in combatting the virus
 while the epidemiological perspective is obviously essential framing the pandemic as a disaster alerts us to the significance of the causal chain of root causes and risk drivers and their interactions with existing or novel hazards both across and within territorial and governance scales
the inescapable political character of social constructs thus reflects strong global centrifugal forces urging a transformational change
 an integrated comprehension of the global and the local as different but complementary spheres of action in which phenomena such as climate change rosenbloom and markard 2020 and the covid-19 pandemic are framed as socially constructed risks is essential to move to a new and different normal transforming the way the global geopolitics and economics are constructed
 unquestionably the pandemic will change the world perhaps for the better if it leads to policies that address the underlying risk drivers or for worse if it furthers greater authoritarianism suppression of individual guarantees and rights exacerbation of inequality and protection of entrenched economic and financial interests over and above human security
 in effect the pandemic has both demonstrated a dire need and opened a window of opportunity to move both national and global systems toward more just and equitable conditions
 
 the current covid-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2
 to date there are no vaccines or specific antiviral drugs to prevent or treat covid-19
 hence it is necessary to accelerate the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines to help mitigate this pandemic
 non-conventional antiviral agents must also be considered and exploited
 in this regard nanoparticles can be used as antiviral agents for the treatment of various viral infections
 these nanomaterials include silver gold quantum dots organic nanoparticles liposomes dendrimers and polymers
 further we consider antiviral mechanisms the effects of nanoparticles on coronaviruses and therapeutic approaches of nanoparticles
 finally we provide our perspective on the future of nanoparticles in the fight against viral infections
 infectious diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms that spread directly or indirectly from one person to another 1 
 fortunately only a handful of these diseases are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality 2 3 
 among them human immunodeficiency virusacquired immune deficiency syndrome hivaids tuberculosis and malaria are the most pronounced
 2020 stated that researchers need to focus on the development of nanomaterial-based technological solutions to fight covid-19 56 
 further we discuss antiviral mechanisms therapeutic approaches of nanoparticles and the effects of nanoparticles on covs
 finally we provide our perspective on the potential of using nanoparticles in the future to treat infectious diseases
virus entry into host cells is required for viral multiplication
 the infection process involves several steps including attachment penetration uncoating replication assembly and release  figure 1 
 the specificity of the interaction determines the kind of virus that infects the host cells
 for example bacteriophages enter the host cell through their nucleic acids and the capsid remains outside of the cell
 some animal and plant viruses enter host cells through endocytosis
 the clinical symptoms of the above pathogen attacks are frequently fever dyspnea cough bronchiolitis and pneumonia 60 
 most respiratory tract infections are caused by sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 61 
 the released viral rna from covs is transcribed and the viral mrna directs protein synthesis
 viruses replicate and assemble into new virions and these are released into neighboring cells via exocytosis
 covid-19 is caused by the novel cov sars-cov-2 4 5 
 sars-cov-2 is 80 and 50 homologous with sars-cov and mers-cov respectively 4 62 
 synthesis of agnps is carried out by various physical chemical and biological methods
 biological methods appear to be environmentally friendly safe biocompatible and non-toxic
 agnps have been used as biomedical therapeutic agents in wound dressings long-term burn care products and anti-bacterial lotions 70 
 polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp-coated agnps homogenized in replens gel 0
 antiviral activity of agnps and chitosan composites was evaluated against h1n1 influenza a virus
 the composites showed significant antiviral activity in a size-dependent manner surprisingly chitosan alone did not show any antiviral effect
 agnps prevent transmissible gastroenteritis virus-induced apoptosis by regulating the p38mitochondria-caspase-3 signaling pathway in swine testicle cells 74 
 further agnps prevented rsv from infecting host cells by inactivating the virus directly 75 
agnps showed antiviral and preventive effects against h3n2 influenza virus infection
 graphene oxide go-agnps composed of two nanomaterials in a single platform were more effective than either single agent
 huy et al reported antiviral activity of agnps against influenza a hbv human parainfluenza hsv and hiv 78 
 agnps synthesized using a green chemistry ultra-sonication approach exhibited antiviral activity against influenza a 79 
 zanamivir-loaded agnps synergistically inhibited h1n1 influenza virus multiplication 80 
 tannic acid-modified agnp-based muco-adhesive hydrogel effectively reduced hsv-2 infectivity at the vaginal mucosal surface 81 
 children are mostly affected by rsv however there is no specific treatment option available
 agnps reduced rsv replication and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines i
 il-1α il-6 and tnf-α and pro-inflammatory chemokines i
 further the agnp-treated animals showed significantly better sera titers of anti-hsv-2 neutralization antibodies than the nacl-treated animals 83 
 agnps interaction with hiv-1 in size-dependent manner and that the bound particles exhibit regular spatial relationships
 agnps undergo preferential binding with the gp120 subunit of the viral envelope glycoprotein
 altogether all these studies demonstrated that the antiviral potential of agnps
 functionalized aunps suppress influenza virus hsv and hiv
 aunps potentially increase antiviral effects through multivalent interactions dendronized aunps inhibit hiv more effectively than dendrons alone 93 94 
 a study was performed to investigate the effect of aunps on schistosoma mansoni-infected mouse liver
 aunps conjugated with peptide triazoles aunp-pt exhibited significant antiviral effects against hiv-1 compared to the corresponding peptide triazoles alone
 nanoparticles functionalized with the flupep ligand showed enhanced antiviral activity compared to the free peptides
 conjugation of flupep to aunps and agnps enhanced antiviral potency 100 
 2018 reported that auncs prevented entry of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv into host cells 101 
 auncs selectively inhibited the proliferation and protein expression of prrsv
 therefore aunps functionalized with different molecules play critical roles in antiviral activity
 however the uses of qd as an antiviral agent are very limited
 furthermore the binding of cdte qds to the cell membrane itself also decreased viral numbers
 cdots significantly inhibited the multiplication of both prv and prrsv
 eda-cdots achieved 100 inhibition and epa cdots achieved 85-99 inhibition 107 
 the use of biomolecules to prepare cdots provides stable and biocompatible materials
 curcumin-mediated cqds cur-cqds were prepared in a one-step heating process and injected with enterovirus 71 ev71 in new-born mice
 these cur-cqds exhibited superior antiviral effects 111 
 after cdot treatment vlps remained intact and no degradation of the vlp capsid proteins was observed 107 
 collectively qds play critical roles in inhibiting various types of viruses
graphene oxide go is a unique single-atom-thick and two-dimensional carbon material arranged in a hexagonal lattice
 go is widely used as an antibacterial and anticancer agent 114 
 go inhibited viral entry into the host cells by structural destruction 117 
 therefore the combination of go and agnps exhibited better antiviral activity compared to either go or silver alone 77 
 curcumin-loaded go exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on rsv infection with significant biocompatibility
 the combination of go and curcumin was more effective than either single agent against rsv infection 118 
 2018 reported that the conjugation of go and qds gqds potentially inhibited the replication of hiv 119 
 hypericin hy-loaded go protected against novel duck reovirus ndrv disease which is a serious infectious disease of poultry
 the antiviral activity of zinc oxide zno micro-nano structures mnss zno-mnss was evaluated in virus infected corneal tissues
 zinc oxide tetrapod nanoparticles zoten induce immune system against hsv-2 virus and provide the therapeutic effects 122 
 zinc oxide tetrapods inhibit herpes simplex virus infection of cultured corneas 123 
2 log10 tcid50 reduction in virus titer when compared to the virus control
 the inhibition rate was much better in pegylated znps compared to unpegylated zno-nps
 the small size can facilitate capillary penetration and uptake by cells resulting in increased concentrations at target sites 129 
 both nanoparticulate formulations led to a dose-dependent reduction of hiv-1 antigen production
 additionally mice were more tolerant toward diphyllin-loaded nanoparticles

 remdesivir seems to be an effective antiviral agent against covid-19 207 
 another drug chloroquine has an immunomodulatory effect and functions at both the entry-and post-entry stages of sars-cov-2 infection 208 
 however all of these agents have undesired side effects
 therefore other agents such as nanoparticles need to be explored as alternative antiviral agents
recently nano and nanomediated combination therapy nanoparticles plus antiviral drugs have shown immense promise in nanomedicine
 in addition the controlled release of ions favors the production of ros

infectious diseases cause immense global mortality and viruses are responsible for about one-third of these deaths
 respiratory infections are among the most common causes of death worldwide especially due to covs
 presently the outbreak of viral respiratory infections particularly covid-19 is widespread and continuing to spread worldwide
 therefore researchers are urgently striving to identify and develop suitable nano-based drugs and nano-vaccines in addition to conventional approaches
 nanotechnology plays a critical role in both viral disease diagnosis and therapeutics
 nanoparticles show great potential for biomedical applications especially in patients who relapse after completing conventional antiviral therapy
 further we discussed antiviral mechanisms therapeutic approaches of nanoparticles and the effects of nanoparticles on covs
 finally we provide our future perspective of nanoparticles below
 antiviral drugs currently available are effective against a few viral diseases such as influenza hepatitis hsv and hiv
 the crucial points and future focus of nano-based antiviral drugs need to be on the following important issues
 second functionalization by specific molecules is needed to facilitate effective targeting of specific sites of viral infections
 third non-or reduced-toxicity must remain a priority biocompatibility with no undesired side effects is essential
 fourth a therapeutic approach that combines nanoparticles and low concentrations of antiviral drugs with excellent efficiency is needed
0005a68bbed13ad78ca3d1be654078b8729f8975  infectious diseases account for more than 20 of global mortality and viruses are responsible for about one-third of these deaths
 highly infectious viral diseases such as severe acute respiratory sars middle east respiratory syndrome mers and coronavirus disease are emerging more frequently and their worldwide spread poses a serious threat to human health and the global economy
 the current covid-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2
 as of 27 july 2020 sars-cov-2 has infected over 16 million people and led to the death of more than 652434 individuals as on 27 july 2020 while also causing significant economic losses
 to date there are no vaccines or specific antiviral drugs to prevent or treat covid-19
 hence it is necessary to accelerate the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines to help mitigate this pandemic
 non-conventional antiviral agents must also be considered and exploited
 in this regard nanoparticles can be used as antiviral agents for the treatment of various viral infections
 the use of nanoparticles provides an interesting opportunity for the development of novel antiviral therapies with a low probability of developing drug resistance compared to conventional chemical-based antiviral therapies
 in this review we first discuss viral mechanisms of entry into host cells and then we detail the major and important types of nanomaterials that could be used as antiviral agents
 these nanomaterials include silver gold quantum dots organic nanoparticles liposomes dendrimers and polymers
 further we consider antiviral mechanisms the effects of nanoparticles on coronaviruses and therapeutic approaches of nanoparticles
 finally we provide our perspective on the future of nanoparticles in the fight against viral infections
 infectious diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms that spread directly or indirectly from one person to another 1 
 zoonotic diseases are infectious diseases of animals that can cause disease in humans when the causal agent is transmitted from animal to human the diseases can account for hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide
 infectious diseases pose a significant threat to both human health and the global economy to date we know of about 200 infectious diseases
 fortunately only a handful of these diseases are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality 2 3 
 among them human immunodeficiency virusacquired immune deficiency syndrome hivaids tuberculosis and malaria are the most pronounced
 in addition several outbreaks of infectious diseases one such alternative approach involves nanomaterials and their fascinating properties which include optimal size shape tunable surface charge superparamagnetism high surface plasmon resonance luminescence photon upconversion bioavailability biocompatibility immunocompatibilitytolerability and biodegradability

 recently sportelli et al
 2020 stated that researchers need to focus on the development of nanomaterial-based technological solutions to fight covid-19 56 
 therefore several articles are expected to provide the basic knowledge regarding nanomaterials and describe how to use these materials for the development of antiviral therapies
 considering the seriousness of infectious disease transmission and the potential of nanomaterials in treating these diseases our review first focuses on the mechanism of entry of viruses into host cells and then on the use of major and important types of nanomaterials such as silver gold quantum dots organic nanoparticles liposomes dendrimers and polymers against various types of viral infections
 further we discuss antiviral mechanisms therapeutic approaches of nanoparticles and the effects of nanoparticles on covs
 finally we provide our perspective on the potential of using nanoparticles in the future to treat infectious diseases
virus entry into host cells is required for viral multiplication
 the infection process involves several steps including attachment penetration uncoating replication assembly and release  figure 1 
 viruses enter host cells through specific receptors on the host cell membrane using attachment proteins in the viral capsid or glycoproteins embedded in the viral envelope
 the specificity of the interaction determines the kind of virus that infects the host cells
 for example bacteriophages enter the host cell through their nucleic acids and the capsid remains outside of the cell
 some animal and plant viruses enter host cells through endocytosis
 once inside the host cell rna viruses such as covs use their genomic for the synthesis of viral genomic rna as well as mrna and eventually the release of the new virions produced in the host cells 57 58 59 
 the human respiratory mucosa is the primary site of virus entry for various viruses including the influenza virus respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus
 these virulent pathogens primarily infect the upper respiratory tract but they may subsequently reach the lower respiratory regions causing more severe illness and ultimately morbidity and mortality
 the clinical symptoms of the above pathogen attacks are frequently fever dyspnea cough bronchiolitis and pneumonia 60 
 most respiratory tract infections are caused by sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 61 
 a unique feature of covs such as sars-cov-2 is their mechanism of entry into host cells initially through binding to the host-receptor cell at the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 protein site
 this is followed by fusion with the host cellular membrane and subsequent release of the viral genetic material into the host cytoplasm or nucleus
 the released viral rna from covs is transcribed and the viral mrna directs protein synthesis
 viruses replicate and assemble into new virions and these are released into neighboring cells via exocytosis
 covid-19 is caused by the novel cov sars-cov-2 4 5 
 sars-cov-2 is 80 and 50 homologous with sars-cov and mers-cov respectively 4 62

 silver nanoparticles agnps are used as antiviral antibacterial anti-inflammatory anti-angiogenesis antiplatelet antifungal and anticancer agents due to their unique physiochemical properties and superior biological functions 54 68 69 
 synthesis of agnps is carried out by various physical chemical and biological methods
 biological methods appear to be environmentally friendly safe biocompatible and non-toxic
 agnps have been used as biomedical therapeutic agents in wound dressings long-term burn care products and anti-bacterial lotions 70 
 polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp-coated agnps homogenized in replens gel 0
15 mgml inhibited hiv-1 transmission of cell-associated and cell-free hiv-1 isolates after 1 min and offered long-lasting protection of cervical tissue from infection after 48 h treatment with no evidence of cytotoxicity observed in the explants
 agnps bind to glycoprotein gp120 on the hiv envelope in a manner that prevents cd4-dependent virion binding fusion and infectivity 53 
 agnp-coated polyurethane condoms pucs efficiently inactivate hiv-1 and hsv-12 and their infectiousness macrophage m-tropic and t lymphocyte t-tropic strains of hiv-1 are highly sensitive
 the agnp-coated pucs can directly inactivate the microbes infectious ability and provide another line of defense against sexually transmitted microbial infections 71 
fungi-mediated synthesis of agnps reduced the viral infection dose in a size-dependent manner against hsv-12 and with human parainfluenza virus type 3 they blocked interaction of the virus with the cell which might depend on the size and zeta potential of the agnps 72 
 antiviral activity of agnps and chitosan composites was evaluated against h1n1 influenza a virus
 the composites showed significant antiviral activity in a size-dependent manner surprisingly chitosan alone did not show any antiviral effect
 conversely agnps alone did exhibit antiviral activity however the composites showed remarkable antiviral activity compared to either agnps or chitosan alone 73 
 agnps prevent transmissible gastroenteritis virus-induced apoptosis by regulating the p38mitochondria-caspase-3 signaling pathway in swine testicle cells 74 
 curcumin-functionalized agnps demonstrated significant inhibitory effects against respiratory syncytial virus rsv infection by decreasing viral titers about two-orders of magnitude to non-toxic concentrations in host cells
 further agnps prevented rsv from infecting host cells by inactivating the virus directly 75 
agnps showed antiviral and preventive effects against h3n2 influenza virus infection
 in the presence of agnps madin-darby canine kidney cells infected with h3n2 influenza virus showed better viability and no obvious cytopathic effects compared to an influenza virus control group
 infected mice treated with agnps showed lower lung viral titers and minor pathologic lesions in lung tissue and longevity 76 
 graphene oxide go-agnps composed of two nanomaterials in a single platform were more effective than either single agent
 go-agnps inhibited feline cov fcov infection by 25 and infectious bursal disease virus ibdv infection by 23 whereas go alone only inhibited fcov 16 and showed no antiviral activity against ibdv 77 
 huy et al reported antiviral activity of agnps against influenza a hbv human parainfluenza hsv and hiv 78 
 agnps synthesized using a green chemistry ultra-sonication approach exhibited antiviral activity against influenza a 79 
 zanamivir-loaded agnps synergistically inhibited h1n1 influenza virus multiplication 80 
 tannic acid-modified agnp-based muco-adhesive hydrogel effectively reduced hsv-2 infectivity at the vaginal mucosal surface 81 
 agnps exhibited antiviral activity against human oncogenic γ-herpesviruses kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and epstein-barr virus by reactivating viral lytic replication through the generation of reactive oxygen species ros and autophagy 82 
 children are mostly affected by rsv however there is no specific treatment option available
 the rsv virion contains two surface glycoproteins f and g that are vital for the initial phases of infection making them critical targets for rsv treatment
 agnps reduced rsv replication and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines i
e
 il-1α il-6 and tnf-α and pro-inflammatory chemokines i

 ccl2 ccl3 ccl5
 mice treated intravaginally with tannic acid ta-mediated agnps showed better clinical scores and lower virus titers in the vaginal tissues
 the ta-mediated agnp-treated group also showed significantly increased percentages of ifn-gamma cd8 t-cells activated b cells and plasma cells while the spleens contained significantly higher percentages of ifn-gamma nk cells and effector-memory cd8 t cells compared to nacl-treated group
 further the agnp-treated animals showed significantly better sera titers of anti-hsv-2 neutralization antibodies than the nacl-treated animals 83 
 agnps interaction with hiv-1 in size-dependent manner and that the bound particles exhibit regular spatial relationships
 agnps undergo preferential binding with the gp120 subunit of the viral envelope glycoprotein
 these interaction between agnps and glycoproteins inhibit the virus from binding to host cells 84 and agnps act as potential antiviral agents against various type of viruses including influenza virus 85 86 
 biologically synthesized agnps using plant extracts of lampranthus coccineus and malephora lutea exhibited significant antiviral activity against different types of viruses such as hsv-1 hav-10 and coxb4 virus 87 
 altogether all these studies demonstrated that the antiviral potential of agnps
gold nanoparticles aunps have also drawn great interest in industry and nanomedicine due to their excellent electrical optical mechanical and biological properties 88 89 
 aunps are used to detect dna sequences proteins bacteria and viruses and they are frequently used in cancer studies and as antiviral and antibacterial agents
 gold nanorod a gnr-5 ppp-ssrna nanoplex-mediated immune activator was reported to inhibit h1n1 influenza viral replication by upregulating the expression of ifn-β and other ifn-stimulated genes isgs resulting in decreased viral replication 90 
 hyaluronic acid aunps and ifn complex have been used for targeted treatment of hepatitis c hcv infection 91 and highly mono-dispersed quasi spherical aunps inhibit hsv
 compared with the clinical drug acyclovir aunps are very safe they do not induce any drug-resistant viral strains and exhibit excellent viricidal properties 92 
 functionalized aunps suppress influenza virus hsv and hiv
 aunps potentially increase antiviral effects through multivalent interactions dendronized aunps inhibit hiv more effectively than dendrons alone 93 94 
 sialic acid-functionalized aunps inhibit influenza virus infection by multivalent interactions relatively better than some synthetic clinical drugs such as zanamivir and oseltamivir which are prone to resistance development by the influenza virus 95 96 
 a study was performed to investigate the effect of aunps on schistosoma mansoni-infected mouse liver
 comparing the treated and untreated infected groups aunps significantly decreased the activities of malondialdehyde and nitric oxide and increased the level of glutathione gsh
 concomitantly aunps ameliorated the inflammatory response by decreasing the mrna expression of interleukin il-1β il-6 tumor necrosis factor tnf-α ifn-γ and inducible nitric oxide synthase 97 
 aunps also inhibited attachment and penetration of foot-and-mouth disease virus fmdv at the early stages of infection and impaired viral replication at later stages at non-toxic concentrations and at early stage 47 
 aunps conjugated with peptide triazoles aunp-pt exhibited significant antiviral effects against hiv-1 compared to the corresponding peptide triazoles alone
 the enhanced virolytic activity and corresponding irreversible hiv-1 inactivation by aunp-pt is due to multivalent contact between the nanoconjugates and metastable envelope spike s proteins on the hiv-1 virus 98 
 conjugation of m2e peptide with aunps and cpg as a soluble adjuvant aunp-m2e  scpg induced lung b cell activation and a robust serum anti-m2e immunoglobulin g igg response in mice
 antibodies generated in response to the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus h5n1 avietnam12032004 are capable of binding to the homotetrameric form of m2 expressed on infected cells 99 
 nanoparticles functionalized with the flupep ligand showed enhanced antiviral activity compared to the free peptides
 conjugation of flupep to aunps and agnps enhanced antiviral potency 100 
 gold nanoclusters auncs composed of tens and hundreds of gold atoms with an average size of 1-2 nm play critical roles in biomedicine
 bai et al
 2018 reported that auncs prevented entry of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv into host cells 101 
 auncs selectively inhibited the proliferation and protein expression of prrsv
 surface modification plays an important role in the antiviral activity of auncs therefore researchers modified the surface of auncs with two different materials-histidine and mercaptoethane sulfonate
 among these histidine-stabilized auncs showed strong inhibition of nanomaterials 2020 10 1645 8 of 29 the proliferation of pseudorabies virus prv 101 102 
 therefore aunps functionalized with different molecules play critical roles in antiviral activity
quantum dots qds are nanocrystals of a semiconducting materials with an average size between 2-10 nm and these are widely used in cell labeling detection and image tracking with particular size-dependent optical and electronic properties includes carbon silver gold cdseszns and so on 103 
 however the uses of qd as an antiviral agent are very limited
 du et al developed gsh-capped cadmium telluride cdte qds and demonstrated that they altered the structure of prv surface proteins inhibiting the virus from entering the host cells 104 
 furthermore the binding of cdte qds to the cell membrane itself also decreased viral numbers
 antiviral effects of stable carbon dots cdots with low toxicity were studied with prv and prrsv as test models of dna and rna viruses respectively
 cdots significantly inhibited the multiplication of both prv and prrsv
 furthermore cdots remarkably induced the production of endogenous ifn and the expression of isgs which are responsible for virus replication 105 106 
 the effect of various surface functionalizations of cdots was studied using 22 -ethylenedioxybisethylamine eda and 3-ethoxypropylamine epa against human norovirus virus-like-particles vlps gi
1 and gii
4
 both eda-and epa-cdots 5 µgml each were highly effective in inhibiting the binding of both strains of vlps to histo-blood group antigen hbga receptors on human cells
 eda-cdots achieved 100 inhibition and epa cdots achieved 85-99 inhibition 107 
benzoxazine monomer-derived cdots inhibited the infectivity of flaviviruses and non-enveloped viruses such as porcine parvovirus and adenovirus-associated virus by directly binding to the surface of virions and inhibiting the first step of virus and host cell interaction 108 
 cdots surface-functionalized with boronic acid or an amine inhibited the entry of hsv-1 into host cells by way of the alteration of viral coat proteins 109 
 the use of biomolecules to prepare cdots provides stable and biocompatible materials
 the antiviral effect of curcumin-stabilized cationic carbon dots ccm-cdots was evaluated against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv as a cov model ccm-cdots were found to inhibit the proliferation of pedv with much higher efficiency than non-ccm-cdots 105 
 ccm-cdots work by changing the viral surface protein structure suppressing the synthesis of virus negative-strand rna and virus budding and then inhibiting viral entry by generation of ros thus stimulating the production of isgs and proinflammatory cytokines 105 
 carbon quantum dots cqds derived from hydrothermal carbonization of ethylenediaminecitric acid inhibited the entry and replication of hcov-229e by interaction of the functional groups of the cqds with hcov-229e entry receptors on the host cell membrane 110 
 curcumin-mediated cqds cur-cqds were prepared in a one-step heating process and injected with enterovirus 71 ev71 in new-born mice
 these cur-cqds exhibited superior antiviral effects 111 
 similarly biocompatible cqds prepared using glycyrrhizic acid gly-cds inhibited the proliferation of prrsv by up to five-orders of viral titer 112 
 gly-cds inhibited prrsv invasion and replication stimulated antiviral innate immune responses and suppressed the accumulation of intracellular ros caused by prrsv infection
 surface charge of the functionalized materials play critical role in the interactions between positively charged cdots and the negatively charged vlps positively charged eda-cdots exhibited a higher inhibitory effect 82 than non-charged epa-cdots 60 107 
 both types of cdots also exhibited inhibitory effects on the binding of vlps to their respective antibodies but they were much less effective in blocking the binding to hbga receptors
 after cdot treatment vlps remained intact and no degradation of the vlp capsid proteins was observed 107 
 to summarize the observed antiviral effects of cdots on noroviruses were mainly through effective inhibition of vlp binding to hbga receptors and moderate inhibition of antibody binding without affecting the integrity of the viral capsid protein and the viral particle
 collectively qds play critical roles in inhibiting various types of viruses
graphene oxide go is a unique single-atom-thick and two-dimensional carbon material arranged in a hexagonal lattice
 go and its derivatives are of immense interest to nanomedicine researchers due to their remarkable electronic mechanical and thermal properties 113 
 go is widely used as an antibacterial and anticancer agent 114 
 go act as antiviral agent through inactivation of the pathogenic agent of hand-foot-and-mouth disease ev71 and endemic gastrointestinal avian influenza a virus h9n2 115 
 nanocomposites consisting of go and partially reduced sulfonated go rgo-so 3  composite showed antiviral activity against hsv-1 by inhibiting hsv-1 from attaching to host cells 116 
 the antiviral activity of go and reduced go was evaluated against prv a dna virus and pedv an rna virus revealing that go significantly suppressed the infection of prv and pedv by a 2-log reduction in virus titers at non-cytotoxic concentrations
 go inhibited viral entry into the host cells by structural destruction 117 
 nanocomposites consisting of go and agnps showed potential antiviral activity against enveloped and non-enveloped viruses for example fcov and ibdv respectively
 viral inhibition assays demonstrated that go-agnps inhibited fcov infection by 25 and ibdv by 23 whereas go alone only inhibited fcov infection by 16 but showed no antiviral activity against ibdv infection
 therefore the combination of go and agnps exhibited better antiviral activity compared to either go or silver alone 77 
 curcumin-loaded go exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on rsv infection with significant biocompatibility
 go inactivates directly by inhibiting the virus from attaching to host cells and considered to be coupled with prophylactic and therapeutic effects on the virus
 the combination of go and curcumin was more effective than either single agent against rsv infection 118 
 iannazzo et al
 2018 reported that the conjugation of go and qds gqds potentially inhibited the replication of hiv 119 
 hypericin hy-loaded go protected against novel duck reovirus ndrv disease which is a serious infectious disease of poultry
 the antiviral activity of the complex gohy was studied in df-1 cells and in ducklings infected with ndrv th11 strain
 gohy showed a dose-dependent inhibition of ndrv replication which may be attributed to direct virus inactivation or inhibition of virus attachment 120 
zinc oxide nanoparticles is a type of metal nanoparticles exhibited significant microbial activity against various type of microorganisms including viruses
 the antiviral activity of zinc oxide zno micro-nano structures mnss zno-mnss was evaluated in virus infected corneal tissues
 partially negatively charged zinc oxide zno-mnss efficiently trap the virions via a novel virostatic mechanism rendering them unable to enter into human corneal fibroblasts-a natural target cell for hsv-1 infection
 zinc oxide tetrapods znots significantly block the entry of herpes simplex virus type-2 hsv-2 into target cells and also stop the spread of the virus
 the znots exhibit the antiviral activity by the ability to neutralize hsv-2 virions that natural target cells such as human vaginal epithelial and hela cells showed highly reduced infectivity when infected with hsv-2 virions 121 
 zinc oxide tetrapod nanoparticles zoten induce immune system against hsv-2 virus and provide the therapeutic effects 122 
 zinc oxide tetrapods inhibit herpes simplex virus infection of cultured corneas 123 
 the antiviral effect of zinc oxide nanoparticles zno-nps and polyethylene glycol peg-coated zno-nps zno-peg-nps on herpes simplex virus type 1 hsv-1
 zinc oxide nanoparticles zno-nps and polyethylene glycol peg-coated zno-nps with concentration of 200 µgml inhibits at the rate of approximately 92 in copy number of hsv-1 genomic dna and also it reduces virus titer 124 
 surface modified zinc oxide nanoparticles could modify the infection potential of hsv-1 via neutralizing the virus rather than through interfering with cellular targets by electrostatic interference of h-znps with virus rather than the hydrophobic interaction znps with virus 125 
 ghaffari et al
 2019 determined the antiviral activity of zinc oxide nanoparticles zno-nps and pegylated zinc oxide nanoparticles against h1n1 influenza virus 126 
 the findings suggest that post-exposure of influenza virus with pegylated zno-nps and bare zno-nps at the highest non-toxic concentrations could be led to 2
8 and 1
2 log10 tcid50 reduction in virus titer when compared to the virus control
 the inhibition rate was much better in pegylated znps compared to unpegylated zno-nps
 zn 2 ions potentially inhibited nidovirus replication and increasing concentration of the intracellular zn 2 concentration can efficiently impair the replication of a variety of rna viruses 127 
 prior incubation of hsv-2 with zinc oxide tetrapod nanoparticles zoten inhibits the ability of the virus to infect vaginal tissue in female balbc mice and blocks virus shedding through neutralizing of virions particles in the host cells and also it stimulate a local immune response 128 
organic nanoparticles are widely used for drug delivery and therapeutic purposes in humans due to their biocompatibility biodegradability and easy surface modification
 the most common organic nanoparticles are polymeric nanoparticles which are colloidal solids ranging from 10 to 1000 nm in diameter
 the small size can facilitate capillary penetration and uptake by cells resulting in increased concentrations at target sites 129 
 polyhexylcyanoacrylate nanoparticles are loaded with either the hiv protease inhibitor saquinavir ro 31-8959 or the nucleoside analog zalcitabine 2 3 -dideoxycytidine
 both nanoparticulate formulations led to a dose-dependent reduction of hiv-1 antigen production
 nanoparticles as a drug carrier system improved the delivery of antiviral agents to the mononuclear phagocyte system in vivo overcoming pharmacokinetic problems and enhancing the activities of drugs for the treatment of hiv infection and aids 130 
 acyclovir loaded into beta-cyclodextrin-poly4-acryloylmorpholine β-cd-pacm nanoparticles exhibited significant antiviral activity against two clinical isolates of hsv-1 compared to both the free drug and a soluble β-cd-pacm complex 131 
 3d8 scfv-loaded plga 3d8-plga nps potentially entered into the cytosolic regions of viral infected cells were released continuously and hydrolyzed rnas in the cytoplasm thereby exhibiting maximal antiviral activity 132 
 diphyllin a vacuolar atpase blocker delivered by polymeric nanoparticles consisting of polyethylene glycol-block-polylactide-co-glycolide peg-plga was more effective in inhibiting feline infectious peritonitis fip caused by a mutated feline cov compared to diphyllin alone
 additionally mice were more tolerant toward diphyllin-loaded nanoparticles
 therefore nanoformulation with polymeric nanoparticles yielded potential antiviral activity against fip 133 
the entry of viruses into host cells is complex and the process of interaction between the virus and host cell typically involves specific protein receptors
 for example multivalent flexible nanogels exhibited broad-spectrum antiviral activity by blocking virus entry and infection 134 
 previously several studies used nanospheres for the treatment of hsv hbv and influenza 135 136 137 138 
 altogether organic nanoparticles can serve as drug delivery agents against various types of viral diseases
dendrimers are highly branched symmetrical macromolecular and hyper-branched structures radiating from a central core via connectors and branching units
 terminal groups are essential for targeting and interactions
 dendrimers are globular and contain three different regions-central core branches and terminal functional groups
 the potential functionality of dendrimers is due to encapsulation of several chemical moieties interior layers and multiple surface groups 139 
 in a study performed to determine the effect of various dendrimers on hsv-12 dendrimers bri-2999 and bri-6741 showed significant reduction of infection rates 140 
 two different type of peptide-derivatized dendrimers such as sb105 and sb105 a10 completely inhibited human cytomegalovirus hcmv replication and also inhibited murine cmv replication whereas they were not able to inhibit adenovirus or vesicular stomatitis virus
 the mechanism of inhibition of peptide-derivatized dendrimers namely sb105a10 bound to human cells through an interaction with cell surface heparan sulfate and thereby blocked virion attachment to target cells 141 
 mice infected with japanese encephalitis jev gp78 strain were administered with morpholinos 5 mgkg body weight via intraperitoneal injection

 jyothi et al
 2015 developed novel liver-targeted cyclosporine a-encapsulated poly lactic-co-glycolic acid plga nanoparticles that inhibited the replication of hcv both in vitro and in vivo 144 
 a liver-specific sustained drug delivery system generated by conjugating a liver-targeting peptide to pegylated csa-encapsulated plga nanoparticles reduced the immunosuppressive effects and toxicity profile of host factor cyclophilin a which is essential for hcv replication 144 
to reduce the development of resistance by viral mutations a study was performed with newly designed and efficient entry inhibitors
 antiviral activity dendrimers as well as fullerene c 60 -with a unique symmetrical and 3d globular structure-were evaluated against an ebola pseudotyped infection model
 the central alkyne scaffold of fullerene connected to 12 sugar-containing 59 fullerene units total 120 mannoses-exhibited outstanding antiviral activity with an ic 50 in the sub-nanomolar range 145 
 the low concentration of camptothecin-loaded dendrimers inhibited hcv replication with very low toxicity
 the triple combination of carbosilane dendrimers tenofovir and maraviroc showed potential for inhibiting hiv sexual transmission 130 131 146 
 polyanionic dendrimers comprising the terminal groups sodium carboxylate hydroxyl and succinamic acid and polycationic dendrimers containing primary amines were used to assess their antiviral activity in mers-cov plaque inhibition assays
 the hydroxyl polyanionic set showed a 17
36-29
75 decrease in mers-cov plaque formation
 all of these dendrimers showed excellent antiviral activity against mers-cov 147 
 the unique properties of dendrimers are due to the presence of numerous surface functional groups which facilitate conjugation with multiple drugs or targeting ligands
 they also have the ability to encapsulate hydrophobic drugs due to their limited cavity size
 vivagel is a g4-poly-l-lysine dendrimer formed from the divalent benzhydylamine amide of l-lysine and it contains 32 terminal anionic functional groups used as an effective antiviral agent 148 
polymers have high antiviral capacity due to their long chains and branches and their flexible molecular design
 polymers can be designed as arbitrary standards based on viricidal effects
 they can be used not only as effective antiviral drugs but also as co-factors for treatment of viral infectious diseases
 polymers carrying antiviral drugs efficiently increase the solubility of antiviral drugs thus prolonging the retention time and enhancing the uptake efficiency of drugs into cells
 for example organotin compounds were prepared according to the needs of universal viral agents 149 
 organotin and cisplatin-like polymers effectively kill viruses by inhibiting viral replication 150 
 the polymers consist of polyphenylene ethynylene ppe-based cationic conjugated polyelectrolytes cpe and oligo-phenylene ethynylenes ope
 they act as antiviral agents by the mechanism of oxidative stress producing singlet oxygen species due to the π bonding system in the backbone of the compound upon exposure to uv-visible light
 the oxidative stress induces damage to macromolecules including dna rna and proteins 151 
 nucleic acid polymers containing hepatitis b surface antigen have been used to treat hepatitis d infection by binding to the amphipathic alpha helix in the class i surface glycoprotein 152 
 polymeric nanogels which are cross-linked hydrogel particles comprising water-soluble and expandable polymers are easily degradable into smaller sized fragments removed by renal clearance
 these polymers can prevent the entry of virus particles into host cells by attaching to the heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the host cell surface
 these flexible nanogels serve as robust inhibitors of hsv-2 virus infections 134 
 chun et al
 2018 designed amphiphilic copolymers comprising methoxy-polyethylene glycol-block polyphenylalanine which consist of encapsulated mir-323a in the core and favipiravir in the exterior layer as both hydrophilic and hydrophobic antiviral agents 153 
 these polymer-carried drugs serve to treat influenza a virus infectious diseases significantly better than naked drug delivery systems without polymers
 the specific advantages of polymers are the sustained release of antiviral agents and the improved metabolic stability of the integrated drug
 these properties demonstrate the great potential of polymeric particles for the successful delivery of antiviral agents 45 
 nanoviricide is a nanomachine that is armed to destroy a particular kind of virus using various types of nanoparticles
 for example polymeric nanoparticles were used to inhibit varicella zoster virus infection in human skin and also polymeric nanoparticles were used for targeted drug delivery to prevent virus spreading and infections
liposomes are spherical in shape with an average size of 20 to 30 nm and are composed of a phospholipid bilayer containing an aqueous core 154 
 hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs can be incorporated into the inner aqueous cavity or the phospholipid bilayer respectively
 liposomes are non-toxic and biocompatible
 when the hiv virus envelop region t cell receptor targeted antisense rna was encapsulated in liposomes hiv-1 production was completely inhibited 155 
 hematopoietic toxicity and antiviral activity of liposomal-encapsulated 3 -azido-3 -deoxythymidine azt were examined in mice for 5 days following intravenous administration 0
4 to 10 mgkg body weight a significantly depressed bone marrow cellularity as well as a corresponding decrease in red blood cells blood neutrophils and monocyte numbers were observed
 treatment with liposomal azt significantly reduced virus proliferation using azt alone 156 
 nanocarbon fullerene lipidosome ncfl inhibited influenza virus h1n1 by a direct killing effect which was comparable to that of rimantadine hydrochloride 157 
 to develop broad-spectrum antiviral agents against a variety of viral infections polyunsaturated liposomes pls were fabricated for use in in vivo drug delivery and to specifically target the endoplasmic reticulum
 these pls contained polyunsaturated fatty acids that exhibit independent antiviral activity by reducing cellular cholesterol
 targeting cholesterol biosynthesis within infected cells is one of the promising targets of many viral systems including hcv hbv and hiv 158 
 pls significantly decreased viral infectivity and secretion in hcv hbv and hiv infections
 pretreatment of cells with pls reduced the infectivity of both hcv and hiv by suppressing plasma membrane cholesterol levels
 cationic liposomes containing both a fluorescence marker calcein and antiviral drugs hpmpc cidofovir ®  were internalized in mdbk cells infected with bovine hsv-1 and significantly inhibited viral replication 159 
 norovirus rdrp is used as an antiviral agent and it is a promising target enzyme for the development of new antiviral drugs
 the polysulfonated naphthylurea suramin has the potential to inhibit murine and human norovirus polymerases
 suramin-loaded liposomes exhibited significant antiviral activity against murine norovirus cultivated in raw 264
7 macrophages 160 
 furthermore surmamin inhibited the replication of various chikungunya viral chikv isolates including sindbis virus and semliki forest virus
 various studies revealed that the antiviral activity and mechanism of suramin is through interference with reinitiation of rna synthesis
 the antiviral effect of suramin-containing liposomes potentially prevents and helps treat chikv infections 161 
 acyclovir-loaded flexible membrane vesicles showed significant antiviral activity in a murine model of cutaneous hsv-1 infection
 the lipid based system exhibited safe treatment 162 
 cationic liposomes loaded with stearylamine sa inhibited viral infectivity without preloaded active pharmaceutical ingredients
 sa liposomes suppressed baculoviral infectivity in several mammalian cell lines including a549 cells
 the sa liposomes are non-toxic and could increase antiviral effects by reducing cholesterol content which intensify concurrently with increased binding of sa liposomes to the cell membrane
 sa liposomes potentiate the entry of virus particles into host cells and are compatible with the antiviral drug acyclovir 163 
 hence liposomes are the best carrier molecules to deliver antiviral drugs
antiviral mechanisms of nanoparticles should target attachment penetration replication and budding of viruses
 possible mechanisms involve inactivation of the virus directly or indirectly prevention of attachment of viruses to host cells and blocking viral replication but they also depend on the form and type of nanoparticles used 57 
 most often nanoparticles block the above steps by altering the structure of the capsid protein and eventually reducing virulence which can be attributed to both physical and chemical means of decreasing the active viral load
 for example lara et al
 2010 demonstrated that agnps bind to glycoprotein gp120 of the hiv envelope preventing cd4-dependent virion binding fusion and infectivity in cell-free and cell-associated viral assays 53 164 
 recently cagno et al
 demonstrated the antiviral mechanisms of broad-spectrum non-toxic nanoparticles against hsv human papilloma virus rsv dengue and lenti virus 165 
 the authors showed that a series of antiviral nanoparticles with long and flexible linkers mimicking heparin sulfate proteoglycans the highly conserved target of viral attachment ligands vals could achieve efficient viral prevention
 this was through effective viral association with binding simulated to be strong and multivalent to the val repeating units 165 
 water-soluble fullerene-polyglycerol sulfates prevented interaction of vesicular stomatitis virus coat glycoprotein with baby hamster kidney cells 166 
 lysenko et al
 2018 proposed that one of the main and direct mechanisms of nanoparticle-mediated antiviral activity is linked to local-field action against the receptors at the virus surface 50 
 in this process the nanoparticles adsorbed on the surface of the cell can greatly alter the membrane potential
 on the other hand the indirect antiviral mechanism of nanoparticles includes blocking the penetration of the virus into the cell due to a change in membrane potential
 collectively these reports suggest that the main mechanisms of nanoparticle antiviral activity involve interaction with gp120 competitive binding between the virus and nanoparticles for the host cell interference with viral attachment inhibition of virus-host cell binding and penetration binding to the plasma membrane inactivation of viral particles prior to entry and interaction with double-stranded dna andor binding with viral particles 96 135 164 167 168 169 170 
 while metal nanoparticles interact with viral particles replication of the virus is blocked figure 3 
 andor binding with viral particles 96 135 164 167 168 169 170 
 while metal nanoparticles interact with viral particles replication of the virus is blocked figure 3 
recently cagno et al
 165 demonstrated the state of the art mechanism of non-toxic nanoparticles against various type of viruses
 the authors developed antiviral products which usually mimic heparan sulfate proteoglycans hspg as well-preserved target of viral attachment ligands vals
 the antiviral effect relies on the binding mechanism of the nanoparticles to the virus surface thus preventing virus-cell attachment
 the most outstanding viricidal effect was found in the aunps coated with a 21 mixture of decanesulfonic acid mus and 1-octanethiol ot
 mus allows a multivalent binding as a consequence of its structure comprising a long hydrophobic chain sulfonic acid terminated
 the enhanced activity of musot-nps was assigned to the new construct using mus linker that caused local distortions and then a global virus deformation leading to irreversible loss of infectivity
 the musot-nps exhibited efficient virucidal effect against hsv-1 and hsv-2 human papilloma virus hpv-16 respiratory syncytial virus rsv dengue and lenti virus
 the synthesized musot-nps exhibited toxic to the virus and non-toxic to the host cells 165 
the possible mechanism of antiviral activity of non-toxic nanoparticles such as gold inhibits viral replication and prevent release of viral particles into the host cells
 the inhibition can take place by nanoparticles act as blockers of neuraminidase enzyme which cleaves the attachment between hemagglutinin on the progeny virus and sialic acid receptor on the host cell
 in this case nanoparticles prevent this cleavage step and interfere with the release of progeny virus from infected host cells and subsequently prevent the progression of infection
 therefore the possible antiviral mechanism could be inhibition of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase activities
 in addition like gold nanoparticles blocking attachment of virus into the host cells

over the last decade nanoscience and nanotechnology have played a critical role in nanomedicine due to the size shape and surface charge of nanoparticles as carriers detection agents and direct inhibitory agents against microbes and cancer cells
 nanoparticles have been shown to be efficient and selective agents for the delivery of therapeutic moieties such as drugs vaccines sirnas and peptides
 in addition nanoparticles have been used to detect and monitor diseases and treat responses using noninvasive imaging modalities
 the size of nanomaterials facilitates their involvement in the efficient delivery of antigens due to surface functionalization they have the capability of co-transporting antigens accompanied by numerous adjuvants
 nanomaterials are able to deliver the drug at suitable concentrations in a precise manner to the proper place and at the proper time 171 
an important aspect of nanomaterials in relation to covs is that they are able to inhibit or compete with viral binding to the host cell-surface receptor
 for example the ace2 receptor plays a critical role in the entry of covs into host cells especially in the case of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 172 
 hence blocking andor decreasing the levels of ace2 could help in the fight against infection as well as in the development of antibodies against ace2
 on the other hand ace2 has a protective effect against virus-induced lung injury after infection as a result of increasing the production of the vasodilator angiotensin 1-7 173 
 therefore preventing covid-19 in the host can be more effective than fighting against the virus after infection
 instead of developing vaccines which typically takes a long time and several rounds of protocols and trials it would be better to try to prevent entry of these viruses into humans using nanotechnology for preparing masks clothes gloves and gums by exploiting ace2-coated nanoflowers and qds 174 
 in addition researchers have demonstrated that nanoflowers and ace2-coated qds can be used as bio-detection probes
 furthermore they have been used to enhance catalytic activity and stability of ace2 and also to produce chewing gums nose filters masks clothes and gloves to prevent entry and spread of covs 174 175 
 therefore if materials used in hospitals were prepared with coated nanoparticles the spread of cov infection may be inhibited
 herein we propose a hypothetical antiviral mechanism involving ace2-coated nanoflowers and ace2-coated qds that could block sars-cov-2 entry into cells by inhibiting attachment of the virus to the ace2 protein while also inhibiting activation of the accessory serine protease tmprss2 figure 4 
a nanoparticle-based intranasal delivery system is an effective and safe tool to deliver several therapeutic moieties such as vaccines drugs sirnas peptides and antibodies
 intranasal delivery is noninvasive practical simple and cost effective
 the intranasal delivery system has been evaluated for vaccination against respiratory viruses such as influenza and covs 176 177 
 nanoparticle-mediated delivery systems have the following benefits-free from enzyme degradation long-term existence release and retention within the system amicable co-delivery with adjuvants specific targeting of cells through receptor-ligand interactions and potentiation of the immune system 178 179 
 may be inhibited
 herein we propose a hypothetical antiviral mechanism involving ace2-coated nanoflowers and ace2-coated qds that could block sars-cov-2 entry into cells by inhibiting attachment of the virus to the ace2 protein while also inhibiting activation of the accessory serine protease tmprss2 figure 4 
 there are major challenges in combatting infectious diseases such as sars mers and covid-19 including the fact that there are no effective drugs or vaccines available
 bachmann and jennings 2010 reported that nanoparticles have the potential to enhance transport in the lymphatic system compared to smaller subunit antigens
 virus-like nanoparticles vlnps play a significant role in vaccine development as vaccine carriers and they can stimulate host-immune responses 180 
 nanoparticle-based vaccines have shown much promise in improving vaccine efficacy immunization strategies and targeted delivery
 vlnps improve vaccine efficacy protect the antigens from premature proteolytic degradation facilitate antigen uptake control release and they are non-toxic 181 
 vlnps are composed of a self-assembled viral membrane that forms a monomeric complex displaying a high density of epitopes 182 
 vlnps can accommodate the expression of additional proteins or the endogenous expression of multiple antigens 183 184 
 due to these specific features and unique qualities vlnps can provide protection not only against viruses but also against heterologous antigens 185 
 a host-immune response was generated after the delivery of an antigen using virus capsid protein sv40 in mammalian cells 186 
 vlnps can increase the immunogenicity of weak antigens including salmonella typhi membrane antigen and influenza a m2 protein
 vlnps containing h1v1 nef gonadotropin releasing hormone gnrh assembled and produced a strong antigen-specific humoral response as well as a cellular immune response 187 188 
 vlnps seem to be better carrier molecules owing to their multiple surface antigens compared to antigen presenting cells which can only present one type of antigen on their surface 189 
 another interesting feature of vlnps is their high surface energy which leads to strong adhesion of biomolecules
 these qualities contribute to a virus mimicking effect that stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies and immune cells to fight viral infections 190 191 
 the combination of aunps with an average size of 100 nm and spike s proteins of infectious bronchitis virus exhibited increased stability when used to developed vlnps and showed a significant retention of the s proteins compared to viral antigens 192 
 vlnps mediated the inhibitory effects of mers-cov s protein nanoparticle vaccine and matrix m1 protein adjuvant combination on mers-cov replication in the lungs of mice
 in addition the mers-cov s nanoparticle vaccine produced a high titer of anti-s neutralizing antibodies and protected against mers-cov infection in mice in vivo
 altogether these studies suggest that vlnps conjugated with s protein seem to be a potential design for a successful vaccine not only to stimulate the immune system but also to protect humans from mers-cov
 this approach can also be applied to sars-cov-2 as both covs use the same mechanism of entry into host cells and similar pathogenicity 193 
 taken together nanoparticles can be used as antiviral agents against various types of viruses including sars-cov-2
emerging and reemerging viruses are responsible for a number of recent epidemic outbreaks
 a vital part of controlling of viruses are predicting and controlling of spreading and infections
 although we are developing various kinds of antiviral drugs to stop spreading and infections of deadly viruses the detection of pathogen is very critical in the first place
 therefore researchers are interested to develop sensitive rapid simple technique for accurate characterization of emerging virus strains
 manual magnetic particle-based extraction methods were developed to detect hiv and hcv viral nucleic acids combination with detection by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr one-step
 these methods can be used to routinely screen blood donation for viremic donors 194 
 liu et al
 2013 developed a rapid diagnostic platform for pathogen detection based on the acetylcholinesterase-catalyzed hydrolysis reaction which is comparable to that of pcr and easily detectable through changing of color 195 
 silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles were prepared by co-precipitation method
 these fe 3 o 4 sio 2 nanoparticles were used to isolate genomic dna of hepatitis virus type b hbv and of epstein-barr virus ebv for detection of the viruses based on polymerase chain reaction pcr
 the results depicted that the purification efficiency of dna of both hbv and ebv using obtained fe 3 o 4 sio 2 nanoparticles was significantly better that commercially available reagents 196 
 yeh et al
 2020 developed a portable microfluidic platform containing carbon nanotube arrays with differential filtration porosity for the rapid enrichment and optical identification of viruses 197 
 this technique used to characterize various type of viruses including rhinovirus influenza virus and parainfluenza viruses
 this enrichment method could be used to rapidly track and monitor viral outbreaks in real time
 zhao et al
 2020 developed efficient magnetic nanoparticles-based viral rna extraction method to detect sars-cov-2 which is comparable with pcr techniques 198 
recently sars-cov-2 emerged as a global threat for both healthcare and the economy
 currently a variety of antiviral agents including re-purposed drugs are under testing in clinical trials to assess their efficacy against this new virus but the mission of finding an effective treatment for covid-19 is ongoing 199 200 201 202 
 previously several modes of treatment were practiced against mers and sars infections including the use of inhibitors of viral and host proteases ifns and host-directed therapies
 ribavirin a nucleoside analog that acts as an rna polymerase inhibitor was used on patients with sars and mers 203 204 
 development of new therapies should focus on the cov s protein because it guides the entry of covs into host cells by participating in the binding and fusion of the virus to the ace2 receptor on the host cell membrane
 the s protein is composed of two subunits-s1 recognizes and binds to host receptors and s2 facilitates fusion between the viral envelope and the host cell membrane 205 
 although several agents have been developed using peptide fusion inhibitors anti-cov neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and entry receptor antagonists none of these potentially curative agents is approved for commercial use in humans 206 
 remdesivir an adenosine analogue is a broad-spectrum antiviral with potent in vitro efficacy against multiple genetically-unrelated rna viruses including ebola sars-cov and mers-cov 38 
 remdesivir seems to be an effective antiviral agent against covid-19 207 
 another drug chloroquine has an immunomodulatory effect and functions at both the entry-and post-entry stages of sars-cov-2 infection 208 
 however all of these agents have undesired side effects
 therefore other agents such as nanoparticles need to be explored as alternative antiviral agents
recently nano and nanomediated combination therapy nanoparticles plus antiviral drugs have shown immense promise in nanomedicine
 metal nanoparticles and metal-loaded nanocomposites are known to be extremely effective against microbes and viruses due to their unique property the controlled release of ions
 for example the controlled release of ionic copper is the fundamental aspect for the antimicrobial and antiviral properties of surfaces 209 
 in addition the controlled release of ions favors the production of ros
 metal-grafted go decorated with metals such as ag fe cu zn tio2 cds and mns 2 exhibited potential antiviral activity 77 210 
 for example silver and copper decorated gos are potential antiviral agents for both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses 77 
 the development of nanomaterial-mediated therapy is an alternative to conventional therapies in fighting against resistant viruses 211 
 agnps are able to interact with host receptors and inhibit viral entry
 functionalized aunps showed antiviral activity against hiv-1 and also against h1n1 h3n2 and h5n1 211 
adaptor protein complex 2 ap2-associated protein kinase 1 aak1 is a key regulator of endocytosis
 hence a drug such as baricitinib that inhibits aak1 may suppress viral entry into target cells
 as such baricitinib could be a potential treatment for covid-19 212 
 baricitinib has been shown to bind to another endocytosis regulator cyclin g-associated kinase and inhibit aak1 thus preventing viral entry into the cell 213 
 hiv protease inhibitors such as lopinavir and ritonavirin suppress 3-chymotrypsin-like protease activity of sars-cov and mers-cov 214 
 remdesivir a nucleoside analogue that targets rdrp suppresses viral rna synthesis in a broad spectrum of rna viruses including hcovs
 remdesivir inhibited rdrp of covs in cell cultures and animal models 201 215 
 a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin can potentially increase the recovery of covid-19 patients
 chloroquine-based drugs inhibit the fusion of sars-cov-2 with host cells by acidifying the lysosomes and thus inhibiting cathepsins that require a low ph for optimal cleavage of sars-cov-2 s protein
 these drugs can also alter cross-talk between sars-cov-2 and host cells and reduce production of pro-inflammatory cytokines while activating anti-sars-cov-2 cd8 t-cells 216 217 
infectious diseases cause immense global mortality and viruses are responsible for about one-third of these deaths
 respiratory infections are among the most common causes of death worldwide especially due to covs
 presently the outbreak of viral respiratory infections particularly covid-19 is widespread and continuing to spread worldwide
 as of 27 july 2020 sars-cov-2 the infectious agent of covid-19 had infected 16430566 individuals and led to the death of more than 652434 individuals in 215 countries while also triggering an exceptional economic crisis
 although there are no specific drugs or vaccines to treat or prevent covid-19 the available antiviral drugs are re-purposed drugs and active against a limited panel of human pathogens
 therefore researchers are urgently striving to identify and develop suitable nano-based drugs and nano-vaccines in addition to conventional approaches
 nanotechnology plays a critical role in both viral disease diagnosis and therapeutics
 nanoparticles show great potential for biomedical applications especially in patients who relapse after completing conventional antiviral therapy
 antiviral resistance which is a slowly developing problem of conventional therapeutic approaches may be addressed using nanoparticles due to their large surface-to-volume ratio surface charge size and shape as well as their optical electronic biological and functional properties
 furthermore nano-based approaches are feasible cost effective non-toxic biocompatible and a convenient strategy to deal with various types of viral infections particularly sars-cov-2covid-19
 in this review we have provided a brief account of the main mechanism of entry of viruses into host cells
 we also discussed in detail the effects of several important types of nanomaterials including agnps aunps qds organic nanoparticles liposomes dendrimers and polymers against various types of viral infections
 these functional nanoparticles can provide a novel platform for fabrication of bio-safe and effective drugs for nanoscale treatment of viral infectious diseases
 further we discussed antiviral mechanisms therapeutic approaches of nanoparticles and the effects of nanoparticles on covs
 finally we provide our future perspective of nanoparticles below
nanotechnology has become a focal point of research and various types of nanomaterials have been explored and evaluated for their prophylactic and therapeutic activity against different viruses
 therefore nanoparticle-based therapy seems to be promising but there are still many challenges and barriers to achieve its full potential
 the future focus of antiviral nano-based therapy should concentrate on development of new antiviral therapeutics and approaches to challenge the emergence of drug resistance and different secondary effects due to long-term conventional treatments
 antiviral drugs currently available are effective against a few viral diseases such as influenza hepatitis hsv and hiv
 generally development of an antiviral drug takes a long time years and the process involves tedious protocols particularly for covs due to their variability
 most of the antiviral drugs developed through nanoparticle research show immense potential in in vitro and in vivo conditions however several variables need to be optimized for a successful translation of nanomaterials from the laboratory to the clinical setting
 in addition one important aspect is the non-toxic nature of nanoparticles which require long and intense studies to demonstrate their non-toxic nature let alone their potential activity against specific viruses
 the biotechnanotech industry needs more exposure to demonstrate the effects of nanoparticles on health and their applications in various fields
 the crucial points and future focus of nano-based antiviral drugs need to be on the following important issues
 first the system needs to have receptor-based nanoparticles which could be safely managed as antiviral agents to rapidly target specific viruses
 second functionalization by specific molecules is needed to facilitate effective targeting of specific sites of viral infections
 third non-or reduced-toxicity must remain a priority biocompatibility with no undesired side effects is essential
 fourth a therapeutic approach that combines nanoparticles and low concentrations of antiviral drugs with excellent efficiency is needed
 finally a multidisciplinary consortium is needed to address potential questions related to various types of viruses variability frequent mutations and antiviral agents and their use in humans particularly during pandemic situations as we are now experiencing
 we believe that the approach presented here has a chance to produce medically-relevant antiviral drugs against covs and other viral diseases

the first sars-cov-2-positive cancer patient was identified on an oncology ward on march 18 2020
 the infection occurred in parallel to the primary diagnosis of acute lymphatic leukemia
 all patients on the affected 2 wards were tested the same night and turned out to be sars-cov-2 negative
 this did also account for 36 further staff members e
 the rki had acknowledged this challenge in its recommendation httpswww
 the whole process including the infection chains is highly complex and currently still under investigation
 despite sars-cov-2 infection we were able to continue antileukemic therapy in several patients in urgent need of therapy
 two patients became pcr negative for sars-cov-2 under continued antileukemic therapy
 in total 6 patients out of this cluster needed mechanical ventilation
 two patients 1 elderly patient with refractory acute myeloid leukemia and an  80-year-old patient with end-stage myelofibrosis had died
 as we are able to report so far this led to a complete and successful containment of the situation
 as of today in a governmental effort beds provided for potential sars-cov-2-infected patients are reimbursed at a defined rate
 the transfer of outpatient visits to phone call visits will be translated into economic compensation rates
 early data on 18 patients from china show a 3
5-fold increased risk for intensive care or mechanical ventilation 8 
 the ucch therefore intensified the regular and structural exchange with its 39 contracted patient support groups

 important offers of the ucch were therefore not cancelled but changed to phone call or video visits
currently the summit of the crisis has most likely not yet been reached in germany
 however in our opinion it is already clear that cancer care will be significantly impacted by the current pandemia
1159000508272 critical benefit-risk assessments and interdisciplinary discussions cannot be ruled out
 guidelines are to be followed but local decisions need to be made
00eaa28403c40a1892c493a5ca2df4ac1e6896f8  with the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemia routine clinical work was immediately deeply and sustainably impacted in germany and worldwide
 the infrastructure of almost all hospitals is currently redirected to provide a maximum of intensive care resources including the necessary staff
 in parallel routine as well as emergency clinical care for all patients in need has to be secured
 this challenge becomes particularly evident in cancer care
 in order to maintain adequate oncological care at all levels of provision and to conduct especially curative and intensive treatments with a maximum of safety continuous adaption of the oncology care system has to be ensured
 intensive communication with colleagues and patients is needed as is consequent expert networking and continuous reflection of the own developed strategies
 in parallel it is of high importance to actively avoid cessation of innovation in order not to endanger the continuous improvement in prognosis of cancer patients
 this includes sustained conduction of clinical trials as well as ongoing translational research
 here we describe measures taken at the university cancer center hamburg ucch -a recognized comprehensive oncology center of excellenceduring the covid-19 crisis
 we aim to provide support and potential perspectives to generate a discussion basis on how to maintain high-end cancer care during such a crisis and how to conduct patients safely into the future
 in hamburg the first case of a sars-cov-2 infection was reported in hamburg in a staff member of the university medical center hamburg-eppendorf uke on february 28 2020
 on march 16 2020 with the beginning of the nationwide lockdown hamburg counted 35 sars-cov-2-positive cases and the university cancer center hamburg ucch started to take the first profound infrastructural measures to protect patients and staff members as well as to prospectively provide resources to face the upcoming challenges of the pandemia
 on april 10 more than 3370 sars-cov-2-positive cases were reported in hamburg more than 250 patients have been treated in hospitals and about 80 of them with intensive care
 the uke continued its extensive preparations to provide a maximum capacity of intensive care beds  150

 hematology and oncology societies e
g
 dgho esmo ebmt asco as well as selected us cancer centers started to report some guidelines for cancer care 1 2 3 4 
 with a wide spectrum of measures the ucch prospectively and continuously faced the challenges and implications of the covid-19 pandemia
 structural aspects were assessed at all levels in order to assure cancer care with maximum safety
in order to assure the best possible cancer care primarily acknowledging the specific situation in oncology as a first step a cancer center task force was formed on march 18 2020 consisting of representatives from the departments of oncologyhematology bone marrow transplantation radiotherapy and nuclear medicine at the ucch
 this ucch task force acts as the key and central group for decisions on safety and preventive measures general and individual decisions on patient guidance and treatment planning of staff resources changes in the ucch infrastructure as well as the management of sars-cov-2 infections in patients and staff members fig
 1 
 according to the rapid dynamics of the crisis and its continuous implications internally and externally task force meetings are held in a fixed schedule 3 times a week with additional ad hoc meetings whenever needed which has proven to be an effective strategy to achieve maximum preparedness
 the task force holds continuous discussions with the infection prevention and control team and the uke board of directors
 general infrastructural measures were implemented in order to protect patients and staff members as well as to provide human staff resources for subsequent transfer to intensive care units icu
 for treatment guidance general measures were developed
 however also acknowledging that outside existing recommendations for oncological treatments individual treatment modifications may result in ethical conflicts the task force has implemented a dedicated team to discuss individual cases requiring treatment in time
 published statements and guidelines of health authorities and cancer societies are continuously reviewed and implemented
 furthermore the task force provides its knowledge on specific expertise in cancer care e
g
 in palliative treatment to the teams directly involved in the management of sars-cov-2-infected patients
in the following the key measures taken by the task force on patient management and treatment guidance are outlined in detail
after careful internal review the management of outpatient cancer chemotherapy care has been adapted as followsoutpatient cancer care of consultations without active treatment − routine follow-up of previously treated patients at the center are rescheduled after telephone contact as long as patients do not report new symptoms
 − phone call visits are implemented for second-opinion questions and visits for communication of radiographic or laboratory chemistry reports
outpatient care of patients with active treatment − all visits for ongoing treatments and visits in clinical trials are continued as planned
 − adjuvant treatment with curative intent is being conducted whenever possible according to the current guidelines
 − palliative treatments are potentially adapted after review of the individual patients situation
 − all outpatients undergoing active treatment at our outpatient clinic are asked to put themselves into a voluntary quarantine and to wear masks when entering the ucch main building throughout all their visit time
in the palliative setting a careful risk-benefit assessment of ongoing therapies needs to be performed
 this implements consideration of cancer-related life expectancy therapeutic alternatives the individual risk of sars-cov-2 infection in the individual social setting the distance to the oncology center and the general risk given by the planned chemotherapy
 to potentially reduce the frequency of visits during ongoing treatments and to adjust them due to restricted staff resources decisions on stretching treatment intervals or switching to oral applications with less frequent control visits were individually discussed
 all discussions occurred in dedicated teams and were implemented whenever this was assumed to be possible without affecting the patients prognosis
currently we hold on to all those implemented measures which resulted in an overall reduction in outpatient visits of 40-50 per week
inpatient cancer care does not typically involve elective or easily shiftable care
 the timely conduction of all treatments with curative intent is of utmost priority e
g
 treatment of acute leukemias high-grade lymphomas or germ cell cancers
 these treatments are more reflecting acuteemergency admissions rather than routine cancer care
 special precautions and regulations are mandatory for autologous and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantations
 here dedicated hematology societies e
g
 ebmt have proposed guidelines on transplantation procedures 2  which we translated into specific measures
allogeneic transplantations − a consequent reduction in the transplant program except for indications without potential therapeutic alternatives was implemented
 − for all other indications a delay in the transplantation procedure was considered as well as a temporary switch to therapeutic alternatives to delay the procedure to a later time point
autologous transplantations − generally treatment with autologous stem cell transplantation was not discontinued but may be adapted to the patients disease course and risk situation
multiple myeloma − autologous stem cell transplantation is continued without delay in patients with high-risk myeloma and in all patients with suboptimal response to induction treatment or significant toxicity e
g
 peripheral neuropathy during induction therapy
 − all other patients are evaluated for a potential extension of induction treatment to 6-8 cycles or replacement of the high-dose treatment concept with an optimized continuous treatment regimen 5 
malignant lymphoma − in relapsing patients with high-grade non-hodgkins lymphoma or hodgkins disease high-dose treatment with autologous stem cell transplantation is in general conducted as planned
germ cell cancer − for patients with high-dose treatment in relapsing germ cell cancer the best curative treatment option is continued to be performed as planned
outside the transplantation program all inpatients treated with curative intent are tried to be managed as scheduled
 in palliative care the guidelines outlined for outpatient care are applied
in all patients who had started radiotherapy treatment interruptions were avoided in order not to prolong overall treatment time
 all other radiation schedules were reviewed to account for prioritization
 − in case of curative intent the treatment schedule is to be startedcontinued at the earliest opportunity
 − in specific entities where prognosis remains unaffected e
g
 in case of hormonally responsive breast or prostate cancer treatment deferral is discussed individually
 − new patient consultations are triaged on a case-bycase basis following discussion with the referring physician
 − in palliative care treatment is limited to function-or life-threatening situations e
g
 spinal cord compression
 − arthrosis radiation is completely discontinued
whilst deferral may seem preferable for the time being it has to be considered that this may have unintended consequences and create a further unmanageable surge in activity when the crisis has passed
all radiation treatment schedules are adapted if needed based on appropriate evidence-based guidelines nccn astro and estro striving for the shortest possible course e
g
 single-fraction treatment for bone pain and hypofractionation schedules where appropriate e

 breast and prostate cancer 6 
 interdisciplinary cancer care in terms of interdisciplinary care for solid cancer patients the surgical departments have dramatically reduced their elective operation programs while at the same time ensuring immediately necessary cancer surgery to be maintained
 interdisciplinary tumor boards are kept running but partially changed to videoconferences andor limiting the number of participants to one representative decision maker per department involved in the case
 special attention has to be put on avoiding delays in consultation and treatment which may adversely affect potentially curable patients
 however due to potential delays in cancer diagnosis resulting from patients avoiding physician visits in the community and from less intensive diagnostic strategies being conducted in private practice care the number of referrals for cancer surgery has dropped by about 25 in the last 4 weeks
patients enrolled in clinical trials are at particular risk and thus they need more specialized and more intensive staff and investigational resources compared to routine clinical care
 clinical care in line with good clinical practice gcp is therefore a major challenge to be maintained during the covid-19 crisis
 competent authorities and clinical trial sponsors have immediately published short-lived guidelines and measures which have to be translated into a study-specific manner 7 with updates and modifications published weekly
 in general all patients who were already included in clinical trials when the outbreak had started should be treated per protocol and as consequent as possible according to the gcp guidelines
 patient access to clinical trials providing a potentially more effective treatment than the approved treatment options should be continued whenever possible
 in accordance to the suggestions of competent authorities on-site monitoring should be replaced by remote monitoring
 the ucch has developed online solutions and standardized patient consents to enable remote monitoring according to the data protection and gcp rules
 however recruitment into trials has dropped by  50 and new trials are not initiated under the current circumstances according to the authorities recommendations
with the beginning of the covid crisis the ucch task force immediately implemented the first concrete safety measures
 to minimize the potential of viral spread all staff members in the outpatient care were taught to comply with the 1
5-to 2-m distance rules
 obligation for wearing surgical masks for nurses whenever being involved in direct patient care as well as for all physicians when entering the outpatient clinic was implemented
 continuously reviewing the situation 2 days later this measure was expanded to all oncology wards radiotherapy hematologyoncology care palliative care and bone marrow transplantation and again 1 week later it was also implemented for all patients in the outpatient care setting at the university hospital
 this measure was drawn much ahead of the suggestions and guidelines of the uke institution and of the health authorities which were later adapted by themselves and therefore remain up to today
a subsequent challenge addressed was to achieve a maximum of safety for patients scheduled for therapies inducing long-term or high-risk aplasia
 at first the general testing of all patients admitted to the ucch was not possible due to general ucch resource limitations
 however effective from march 25 all patients admitted for intensive chemotherapies with anticipated prolonged aplasia such as leukemia treatments or high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation as well as those with b-cell-directed therapies were admitted to a dedicated area of one of our hematology wards to be immediately tested for a potential sars-cov-2 infection or colonization and kept in protective isolation for 24 h
 with reporting of a pcr-negative test result the patient is transferred to the specialized ward receiving the scheduled treatment
 after repetitive institutional considerations routine testing for sars-cov-2 was expanded to all admissions on all oncology wards by the beginning of april
to minimize the patients contacts with additional persons an early-implemented general ban for all visitors which was effective from march 19 for the cancer center wards had an additional marked beneficial protective effect on hospitalized patients
a broad challenge in human resource management is the daily balance of providing staff support for the growing icu of the university hospital without decreasing high-level cancer care
 in addition it has to be expected that a marked amount of staff members might also be affected by the sars-cov-2 infection or be put under quarantine and thus will not be able to come to work for a defined time
 in order to generate a reliable system all on-duty services of the departments physicians were placed with a dedicated substitute and a specific stepwise plan for staff members switching to the icu team when need was developing
 at the same time the board of di-oncol res treat doi 10
1159000508272 rectors of the uke has allowed the ucch to continue planning their own patient admission schedule to manage the necessary treatment cycles
the first sars-cov-2-positive cancer patient was identified on an oncology ward on march 18 2020
 the infection occurred in parallel to the primary diagnosis of acute lymphatic leukemia
overall the spread of the first sars-cov-2 infection was limited with in total 6 persons proven to be sars-cov-2 positive 1 patient and 5 staff members who were tested positive during their quarantine
 all patients on the affected 2 wards were tested the same night and turned out to be sars-cov-2 negative
 this did also account for 36 further staff members e
g
 physicians nurses psychooncologists and physiotherapists regarded at increased risk for transmission category i  15 min face-to-face contact to the infected patient without protection according to the guidelines of the german health authority robert koch institute rki
 the enormous number of contact persons identified also clearly showed the impact of 1 affected patient on the infrastructure in a hospital with several staff members having to be put immediately into quarantine
 this example also elucidated that the quarantine rules are per se not always feasible in a center running with highvolume and high-quality cancer care which requires a large amount of highly qualified staff
 the rki had acknowledged this challenge in its recommendation httpswww
 rki

internet061doc13848752bodytext2
 for our center additional repetitive sars-cov-2-specific pcr monitoring of asymptomatic staff 5 6 7 and 9 days after the last at-risk contact was implemented
 even more important implementation of consequent staff protection rules by the task force had the goal to consequently avoid category i contacts
 this accounts for direct patient care with adequate mask protection but also restrictions and protection during regular personal exchanges among nurses and physicians
 in this context it has to be mentioned that all contacts with low risk of transmission category ii  15 min face-to-face contact to the infected patient were offered testing on a voluntary basis 7 days after the last at-risk contact by the institution
 all staff members tested in the follow-up monitoring of asymptomatic personnel 5 6 7 or 9 days after the last at-risk contact turned out to be negative
 overall the liberal testing offered for employees by the uke turned out to be positive in the sense of patient and staff protection it enables early identification of oligo-and asymptomatic but infected staff members and therefore also identifies those who come to work despite being affected but have the immediate wish to help in a crisis of limited resources
including the first 2 patients described a cluster of overall 22 cancer patients with a sars-cov2 infection was identified between march 18 and the so far preliminary end point april 24 including patients affected by hematological cancers leukemia lymphoma and multiple myeloma
 these cases which have led to an extensive screening of all patients in our center as well as all the various staff members
 the whole process including the infection chains is highly complex and currently still under investigation
 as mentioned before the first detected infection was most likely imported into our center by an outpatient with primary diagnosis of acute lymphatic leukemia who was concomitantly affected by covid-19
 at a time point more than 2 weeks later when the majority of patients of the general cluster was diagnosed with sars-cov-2 the staff members of all oncology wards were already working under mask protection
 also screening procedures for sars-cov-2 on the oncology wards and for patients admitted with hematological cancers and the general ban for all visitors had been implemented and indeed the majority of patients affected had actually been tested negative for sars-cov-2 before admission or during their inpatient stay
 all infected cancer patients were transferred from the oncology center to a dedicated covid ward of the uke guided by an interdisciplinary dedicated team of physicians specialized in general internal medicine and oncology
 the oncology team is solely situated in the covid-19 area of the main uke building and acts completely separately from the ucch in order to provide and continue cancer treatment for sars-cov-2-positive patients on the above-mentioned specialized ward and on the icu
 despite sars-cov-2 infection we were able to continue antileukemic therapy in several patients in urgent need of therapy
 two patients became pcr negative for sars-cov-2 under continued antileukemic therapy
 the clinical course of sars-cov-2 infection was highly variable ranging from asymptomatic to oligosymptomatic cases up to severe covid-19-affected lung disease
 in total 6 patients out of this cluster needed mechanical ventilation
 two patients 1 elderly patient with refractory acute myeloid leukemia and an  80-year-old patient with end-stage myelofibrosis had died
 in the context of the sars-cov-2 cluster main extended measures taken were containment of 4 wards for 2 weeks repetitive and complete screening of all admitted patients and all staff members of the center including those without direct patient contacts and the change from standard to ffp2 masks in the whole building
 as we are able to report so far this led to a complete and successful containment of the situation
 the economic aspects of the covid-19 crisis in the ucch but also in general for the academic health system are currently unpredictable
 as of today in a governmental effort beds provided for potential sars-cov-2-infected patients are reimbursed at a defined rate
 as all wards involved in cancer care are mainly unaffected by those regulations when patients admitted are of unmet therapy need the financial gap might be not as large as in other disciplines
 the overall resource utilization in the ucch wards was  90 during march clearly indicating that inpatient cancer treatment cannot be paused during the virus pandemic outbreak
 however a more stringent isolation policy with more single room use and use of inpatient resources for testing will reduce the number of patients treated
 the transfer of outpatient visits to phone call visits will be translated into economic compensation rates
 in our opinion all efforts have to be done to avoid financial restrictions in cancer care now and in the near future
acting as a long-term funded center of excellence by the german cancer aid dkh the ucch consists of an established partner network of 19 office-based oncologists and 20 contracted surrounding partner hospitals
 the ucch acknowledged its central coordinating role in this network during the covid-19 pandemia to assure ongoing optimized care for all patients affected by cancer in the region
 in parallel we see the utmost responsibility as a cancer center to provide all available resources to generate the maximum scientific information out of this severe crisis to improve the management of similar events in the future as well as the current crisis
on march 20 2020 the ucch launched the first online oncology platform which provides a forum to actively communicate foreseeable or unforeseeable capacity limitations of cancer care at specific hospital locations and to consequently connect partners in need with those who can potentially provide free capacities ucch-covid-helpuke
de
 in parallel the platform is constantly being developed as a forum to exchange relevant information over the pandemia development emerging medical insights as well as guidelines and expert opinions
in the extensive considerations about the optimal cancer care during the current pandemia it is obvious that only very limited data exist about the clinical course of the sars-cov-2 infection in cancer patients
 early data on 18 patients from china show a 3
5-fold increased risk for intensive care or mechanical ventilation 8 
 however the implication of different oncology entities and specific treatment modalities the impact of immunosuppression aplasia or other distinct high-risk situations are unclear so far
 this is even more relevant as current data suggest a potential role of a cytokine storm leading to potentially severe lung impairment
 consequently the question arises if specific drugs used in oncological treatment such as immune-oncological treatments monoclonal antibodies or targeted therapies might potentially also have a distinct effect on the clinical course
 to address these questions the ucch and its network together with the university hospitals in kiel and lübeck have now initiated a prospective observational trial where sars-cov-2 infections in cancer patients are systematically reported including prospective biobanking of peripheral blood samples
cancer patients are now not only affected by the diagnosis of the malignant disease but also by all concerns arising during the covid-19 pandemia
 in addition to the already existing existential fears anxiety is also associated with a potential sars-cov-2 infection and the potential general infrastructural restrictions regarding radiographic investigations surgical interventions delays in treatment or limitations regarding access to the oncology centers
 the limitations in staff resources during the pandemia is in opposition to the need of even more time for explanations to the individual cancer patient
 the ucch therefore intensified the regular and structural exchange with its 39 contracted patient support groups
 a weekly online newsletter service provides relevant information regarding the covid-19 pandemia in a patient-understandable language
 psychooncology support consultations in complementary medicine sports and nutrition counseling i
e
 important offers of the ucch were therefore not cancelled but changed to phone call or video visits
currently the summit of the crisis has most likely not yet been reached in germany
 how many patients will need mechanical ventilation or how that in reality will affect the staff resources of all other departments is so far not predictable and may also be of different extent in different federal regions
 however in our opinion it is already clear that cancer care will be significantly impacted by the current pandemia
 although we are convinced that cancer care can still be provided for all patients in need potential disadvantages for individual patients despite sars-cov-2 covid-19 and cancer 7 oncol res treat doi 10
1159000508272 critical benefit-risk assessments and interdisciplinary discussions cannot be ruled out
 furthermore we have to anticipate that due to the current changes in social behavior and resources cancer diagnosis will be delayed and more patients will be diagnosed in the near future at a more advanced stage
 the unrestricted access for patients to the innovative technologies in oncology to clinical trials second opinions and center-specific treatments will not be kept up as before the covid-19 pandemia
 the temporary shutdown in translational research will lead to a delay in relevant and groundbreaking findings which will extend far beyond the time of the pandemia fundamental experiments will be delayed grant applications will not be submitted in time and manuscripts will potentially not be completed
 in parallel relevant third-party funding will be redirected towards funding to unravel the burden of the sars-cov-2 infection and covid-19
 cancellation of conventions and meetings will negatively impact the scientific exchange in the expert community and will lead to a lack in interdisciplinary and multinational networks
 high-ranked political initiatives such as the national decade against cancer in germany or the european beating cancer plan are in danger of significant slowdown
 the german cancer center heidelberg dkfz and the german cancer aid dkh have initiated a process to monitor the conduction of cancer care and research in the dedicated german comprehensive cancer centers
 guidelines are to be followed but local decisions need to be made
 facing all those challenges it is now the time to use the current unprecedented team spirit and solidarity which is also generated during this crisis as an alternative strategy for knowledge generation and transfer
 cancer does not stop
 day by day we all have to face the responsibility to secure cancer care for all patients and to continue to optimize cancer treatment to promote the innovation and to provide simultaneously unrestricted support while offering staff and knowledge to our colleagues fighting in the icus against this devastating pandemia with the common aim to overcome this critical crisis

 our frequency range is restricted to the most sensitive band of the gw detectors namely 20-500 hz
 while gravitational radiation from core-collapse supernovae is expected to contain frequency content above this band radice et al
 2019  detection of bursts above a few hundred hz is not energetically favorable see e
 2019a  and increasing the frequency upper limit also increases the computational cost
 the maps are scanned for clusters of pixels with excess energy referred to as events
 these are based on correlations between data in different detectors and reject events associated with noise transients
 the surviving event with the largest ranking statistic is taken to be the best candidate for a gw detection
 its significance is evaluated in the same way as the modelled analysis but with 660 s long off-source trials
 in order to ensure that the significance is assessed at a sub-percent level we require at least ∼ 1
5 hours of coincident data from at least two detectors around the time of a grb
 non-gaussian noise transients or glitches are handled as described in abbott et al
 these models are intended to represent the gws from stellar collapses

5 × 10 −3 grb 190804058 and 2
7 × 10 −2 grb 190601325 respectively
 both cumulative distributions are within the 2σ lines and therefore compatible with the no-signal hypothesis
 these figures indicate that the lowest p-value found by each search is compatible with the no-signal hypothesis
 we apply a weighted binomial test described in abadie et al

in addition to confirming the origin of some short grbs combining data from observations of gw170817 and grb 170817a allowed for the inference of basic properties of short grb jets

 2017 
 these jets are thought to be collimated and roughly axisymmetric emitting preferentially in a narrow opening angle due to a combination of outflow geometry and relativistic beaming
 the data from extensive multi-wavelength observation campaigns that ran for nearly 20 months following the merger troja et al

 further according to one of the models proposed as the jet drills through the surrounding merger ejecta it inflates a mildly relativistic cocoon due to interactions between the material at the edge of the jet and the ejecta lazzati et al

1 for details
 these searches were able to process 105 and 32 grbs in o3a respectively
the scope of these targeted searches is to enhance our ability to detect gw signals in coincidence with grbs with respect to all-sky searches for transient gw signals carried out by the ligo-virgo collaboration abbott et al
 2019c abbott et al
  2020c 
 these may lead to joint gw-grb detections in the case of loud gw events as for gw170817 and grb 170817a but the targeted searches we report on here aim at uncovering subthreshold gw signals by exploiting the time and localization information of the grbs themselves
 the fermi gamma-ray burst monitor gbm team conducts an analogous effort when searching through gbm data for gamma-ray transients coincident with confirmed events and low significance candidates reported by ligo-virgo offline analyses hamburg et al
 2020 
 similarly the swiftburst alert telescope bat team has developed their own autonomous pipeline to enable subthreshold grb searches for externally triggered events tohuvavohu et al

 this makes the secondary compact object either the lightest bh or the heaviest ns known to be in a compact binary system
while there is considerable uncertainty in source type for all three of these events gw190425 is the one for which the prospects of observing an associated grb were most promising as it is consistent with a bns merger rather than a binary bh merger or a nsbh merger with high or moderately high mass ratio
 however no confirmed electromagnetic or neutrino counterparts were observed in association with this event hosseinzadeh et al
 2019  lundquist et al
 2019  abbott et al
 2020a  coughlin et al
 2020  but also see pozanenko et al
 2020  despite extensive searches which are logged in the gamma-ray coordinates network gcn circular archive
 1 there are a number of reasons for which an electromagnetic counterpart associated with gw190425 may not have been detected
 firstly the large area covered by the localization region of gw190425 determined from gw data  8000 deg 2  posed a considerable challenge for electromagnetic follow-up
 45
4 of this localization region was occulted by the earth for the fermi satellite so if gamma-rays were emitted from the source it is possible they were not detectable
 other gamma-ray observatories with lower sensitivities to short grbs such as integral and konus-wind were covering relevant fractions of the localization region however martin-carrillo et al
 2019 svinkin et al
 2019 
 secondly grb jets are expected to be aligned with the total angular momentum of the binary system and thus more easily detectable at small viewing angles
 the binary inclination angle of gw190425 was poorly constrained so it is possible that a jet from this system was formed but was oriented away from our line of sight
 additionally the luminosity distance inferred for gw190425 ∼ 160 mpc was significantly larger than that for gw170817 ∼ 40 mpc
 grb 170817a which followed gw170817 was such an exceptionally faint short grb abbott et al
 2017a  that its prompt emission photon flux would have dipped below the detection threshold for fermi-gbm had the source had been farther than ∼ 75 mpc the grb abbott et al
 2017a goldstein et al
 2017  and by ∼ 100 mpc it would become undetectable by swiftbat tohuvavohu et al
 2020 
 thus if emission from the system that produced gw190425 was similarly faint it would not have been detectable by swiftbat or fermi-gbm
 therefore we do not necessarily expect a grb detection to be associated with gw190425 due to its almost unconstrained inclination angle large localization region and distance even if gamma-rays were emitted from this system
 scenarios like this one further motivate the need for gw follow-up analyses of grb events which by definition constrain the sky localization and inclination angle of the progenitor
in section 2 we discuss the set of grbs analyzed in this paper
 in section 3 we summarize the two targeted search methods used to follow up grbs
 section 4 presents the results obtained with these two methods
 we also consider each of the two sets of results collectively and quantify its consistency with the no-signal hypothesis
 finally in section 5 we provide our concluding remarks
the sample of grbs analyzed in this paper includes events circulated by the gcn 2 complemented with information from the swiftbat catalog lien et al
 2016  3 the online swift grbs archive 4 and the fermi gbm catalog
 5 gruber et al
 2014 von kienlin et al
 2014 narayana bhat et al
 2016  once an alert detailing an event has been received via the gcn the dedicated vetting automation and literature informed database valid coyne 2015 is applied to find the latest grb results by comparing the time and localization parameters with those in tables relating to each satellite the published catalogs and an automatic literature search
 the gcn notices provide a set of 141 grbs during the o3a data taking period 1 april 2019 1500 utc -1 october 2019 1500 utc
as mentioned in the introduction we carry out two searches with distinct assumptions about signal morphology see sec
 3 for details on both methods a search for generic gw transients and a modelled search for gw signals from ns binary i
e
 bns and nsbh inspirals
 we do this because grbs of different dura-tions are expected to have different origins and therefore different gw signal morphologies
 in particular if a compact binary merger were to produce a grb it would be expected to have a short duration
 in order to specifically target such phenomena with the modelled search we classify each grb as long short or ambiguous
 this classification relies on the measurement of the time interval over which 90 of the total backgroundsubtracted photon counts are observed t 90  with error δt 90 
 when t 90  δt 90   2 s the grbs are labeled as short when t 90 − δt 90   4 s the grbs are labeled as long the rest are labelled as ambiguous
 the unmodelled search for generic transients is applied to grbs of all classifications
 all of the short and ambiguous grbs are additionally analyzed with the modelled search in order to maximize the chances of uncovering any potential binary coalescence candidate
the classification process results in 20 short grbs 108 long grbs and 13 ambiguous grbs
 as in abbott et al
 2019b we require a minimum amount of coincident data from at least two gw detectors around the time of a grb for the generic unmodelled gw transient search to assess the significance of a gw candidate with sub-percent level accuracy see sec
 3
2 for technical details
 this requirement is applied to grbs of all classifications and results in 105 grbs being analyzed with this method out of the 141 grbs recorded by fermi and swift during o3a
 this amounts to 74
5 a percentage of events that is compatible with the fraction of observing time during which at least two interferometers in the network were operating in observing mode 81

1 for technical details set the minimum amount of data needed from at least one detector around the time of the grbs

 this value matches the fraction of observing time during which at least one interferometer in the network was operating in observing mode during o3a 96

 all three fall beyond the detection range of our interferometers and are not expected to produce measurable gw results
 regardless of availability of redshift information however we follow up as many grbs as we can and we were indeed able to analyze these three cases
we now provide a description of the two targeted search methods used in this paper
 these are the same methods applied to gw data coincident with grbs that occurred during the first abbott et al

this analysis searches for a gw signal compatible with the inspiral of a bns or nsbh binary -collectively ns binaries -within 6 s of data associated with an observed short grb
 this stretch of data is the onsource window and runs from −5 s to 1 s around the start of the grb emission i
e
 the grb trigger time
 the surrounding ∼30-90 minutes of data are split into 6 s off-source trials which are also analyzed in order to build a background
 ∼30 minutes allow the modelled search to accurately estimate the power spectral density of the available instruments and ensures that it can assess at sub-percent level accuracy the significance of any candidate events found in the on-source window
 all the data is processed with pygrb harry  fairhurst 2011 williamson et al

 aside from the updated sensitivity of our detectors the only difference with respect to the second ligo-virgo observing run abbott et al
 2019b is that the generation of the bank has been updated to apply more accurate physics to determine whether an nsbh system could produce an accretion disk from this disruption foucart et al

 we only search for circularly polarized gws which may be emitted by binaries with inclinations of 0 • or 180 •  such systems have gw amplitudes that are consistent williamson et al
 2014  with those of binary progenitors with inclination angles over the full range of viewing angles that we expect for typical brightness grbs  30 • fong et al
 2015  as the ones in our sample
the strength of any potential signal is ranked via a coherent matched filter signal-to-noise ratio snr harry  fairhurst 2011 williamson et al
 2014  which is reweighted according to a χ 2 goodness-of-fit between the template that identified it and the signal itself
 the significance of the latter is quantified as the probability of background alone producing such an event
 this is evaluated by comparing the re-weighted snr of the loudest trigger within the 6 s on-source to the distribution of the re-weighted snrs of the loudest triggers in the 6 s off-source trials
 when data from more than one detector is available this background snr distribution is extended by generating additional off-source trials via time slides that is by combining data from detectors after introducing time shifts longer than the light-travel time across the network
 specifically our time shifts are 6 s long in order to match the width of the on-source window and the off-source trials
in order to derive the sensitivity of this search to potential grb sources simulated signals are injected in software into the off-source data
 the 90 50 exclusion distances d 90 d 50  are defined as the dis-tances within which 90 50 of the injected simulated signals are recovered with a greater ranking statistic than the loudest on-source event
 three different astrophysical populations are considered bns binaries with generically oriented -i
e
 precessing -spins aligned spin nsbh binaries and nsbh binaries with generically oriented spins
 these simulated signals cover a portion of parameter space that extends beyond the one covered by the template bank as they include ns dimensionless spin values up to 0
4 and for two families of injected signals admit precession
 as stated previously the templates used to filter the data are produced using imrphenomd
 in order to factor into the sensitivity assessment any potential loss due to uncertainties in gw signal modeling the injected signals are not produced with the same model used for the templates
 precessing bns signals are simulated using the taylort2 time-domain post-newtonian inspiral approximant spintaylort2 sathyaprakash  dhurandhar 1991 blanchet et al

 injected signals have a range of total inclinations from 0 • -30 • and 150 • -180 • whilst removing any systems which could not feasibly produce a short grb pannarale  ohme 2014
x-pipeline looks for excess power that is coherent across the network of gw detectors and consistent with the sky localization and time window for each grb
 as in the first two observing runs we use a search time win-dow that begins 600 s before the grb trigger time and ends 60 s after it or at the t 90 time itself whichever is larger
 this window is long enough to encapsulate the time delay between gw emission from a progenitor and the grb prompt emission koshut et al

 our frequency range is restricted to the most sensitive band of the gw detectors namely 20-500 hz
 while gravitational radiation from core-collapse supernovae is expected to contain frequency content above this band radice et al
 2019  detection of bursts above a few hundred hz is not energetically favorable see e
g
 fig
 4 in abbott et al
 2019a  and increasing the frequency upper limit also increases the computational cost
the generic transient search pipeline coherently combines data from all detectors and produces timefrequency maps of this gw data stream
 the maps are scanned for clusters of pixels with excess energy referred to as events
 the events obtained this way are first ranked according to a detection statistic based on energy and then subject to coherent consistency tests
 these are based on correlations between data in different detectors and reject events associated with noise transients
 the surviving event with the largest ranking statistic is taken to be the best candidate for a gw detection
 its significance is evaluated in the same way as the modelled analysis but with 660 s long off-source trials
 in order to ensure that the significance is assessed at a sub-percent level we require at least ∼ 1
5 hours of coincident data from at least two detectors around the time of a grb
 non-gaussian noise transients or glitches are handled as described in abbott et al
 2019b 
similarly to the modelled search we quantify the sensitivity of the generic transient search by injecting simulated signals into off-source data in software and recovering them
 calibration errors are accounted for by jittering the amplitude and arrival time of the injections according to a gaussian distribution representative of the calibration uncertainties in o3a abbott et al
 2017c 
 we report results obtained for four distinct sets of circular sine-gaussian csg waveforms with fixed quality factor q  9 and with central frequencies of 70 100 150 and 300 hz see equation 1 and section 3

 these models are intended to represent the gws from stellar collapses
 in all four cases we set the total radiated energy to e gw  10 −2 m c 2  a choice that is about an order of magnitude higher compared to the results presented in abbott et al

 as optimistic representatives ott  santamaría 2013 of longer duration gw signals detectable by the unmodelled search we use accretion disk instability adi waveforms van putten 2001 van putten et al
 2014 
 in these adi models instabilities form in a magnetically suspended torus around a rapidly spinning bh causing gws to be emitted
 the model specifics and parameters used to generate the five families of adi signals that we consider are the same as in table 1 and section 3

 2017c 
during o3a we used the generic transient method to follow up a total of 105 grbs whereas the modelled search was applied to the 32 grb triggers classified as short or ambiguous
 for all of the most gw-signallike triggers associated with the examined grbs the searches returned no significant probability of incompatibility with background alone p-value
 this indicates that no gw signal was uncovered in association with any of these grbs
 this is consistent with the estimated gw-grb joint detection rate with fermi-gbm of 0
07-1
80 per year reported in abbott et al
 2019b 10 −2 10 −1 10 0 p-value for the 2019-2020 ligo-virgo observing run
 the most significant events found by the generic transient method and by the modelled search had p-values of 5
5 × 10 −3 grb 190804058 and 2
7 × 10 −2 grb 190601325 respectively
 figures 1 and 2 show the cumulative distributions of p-values returned by the modelled search and the generic transient search respectively
 for cases in which no associated on-source trigger survived the analysis cuts of the modelled search the associated p-value ranges between 1 -i
e
 an upper bound on a probability -and the fraction of background trials for the grb that also yielded no associated gw trigger
 in both figures the expected background distribution under the no-signal hypothesis is shown by the dashed line and its 2σ limits are indicated by the two dotted lines
 both cumulative distributions are within the 2σ lines and therefore compatible with the no-signal hypothesis
 these figures indicate that the lowest p-value found by each search is compatible with the no-signal hypothesis
having found no gw signal associated with the grbs followed up by our searches we consider the set of modelled search results and the set of generic transient search results collectively
 we apply a weighted binomial test described in abadie et al
 2012 to evaluate how consistent each set of results is collectively with the no-signal hypothesis
 this test is conducted using the most sig- 
 cumulative histograms of the 90 confidence exclusion distances d90 for the bns blue thin line and generically spinning nsbh orange thick line signal models shown for the sample of 32 short and ambiguous grbs that were followed up by the ns binary modelled search during o3a all of which did not have an identified gw counterpart
 for a given grb event and signal model d90 is the distance within which 90 of simulated signals inserted into off-source data are recovered with greater significance than the most significant on-source trigger
 these simulated signals have inclinations θjn -the angle between the total angular momentum and the line of sight -drawn uniformly in sin θjn with θjn restricted to 0nificant 5 of p-values in the sample weighted by a prior probability of detection estimated using the network detector sensitivity at the time and location of each grb
 this final probability of observing this distribution of pvalues given background alone i
e
 under the no-signal hypothesis is 0
43 0
31 for the modelled generic transient search method
 therefore both searches gave no significant evidence for a population of unidentified subthreshold gw signals
 for the analyses carried out in the first observing run of advanced ligo and advanced virgo o1 the combined p-values were 0
57 and 0
75 for the modelled and generic transient search respectively abbott et al
 2017c  in the second observing run of advanced ligo and advanced virgo o2 they were 0
30 and 0
75 abbott et al
 2019b 
in fig
 3  we show the cumulative 90 exclusion distances for the 32 short and ambiguous grbs followed up with the modelled search
 the lowest exclusion distance values ∼ 20 mpc were obtained for ambiguous grb 190409901
 this is due to the fact that only virgo data was available for this grb and that the sky location of this event was in a direction in which virgo had ∼ 30 sensitivity with respect to an optimal sky location
 for each of the three simulated signal classes we quote the median of the 32 d 90 results in the top part of table 1 
 all three values are 40-60  times higher than those reported in abbott et al
 2019b for the previous ligo-virgo observing run
 the individual d 90 values for each class of simulated signals are reported in table  2  at the end of this paper
 as a term of comparison during the six month duration of o3a the hanford and livingston advanced ligo instruments and the virgo interferometer had bns ranges 8 of 108 mpc 135 mpc and 45 mpc respectively
 we also place a 90 confidence level lower limit on the distance for each of the 105 grbs analyzed by the generic transient search assuming the various emission models discussed in sec

 these vary roughly over one order of magnitude which reflects the wide range of models used in the analysis

for each event in the o3a sample that was localized with an error radius smaller than 0
5 •  we searched glade dálya et al
 2018 for galaxies within 200 mpc
 we then compared the angular separation between each grb and galaxy and recorded all separations less than or equal to twice the error radius for each grb
 of the 141 events in our sample 4 had nearby galaxies according to the definition above grb 190530430 grb 190531840 grb 190610a and grb 190731943 
 data for our gw follow-up analysis was available only in the case of the short grb 190610a first observed by swiftbat evans et al
 2019  and localized to within a 90 error radius of 1

 2019 lien et al
 2016 
 on the edge of its localization region there is a nearby galaxy at a luminosity distance of approximately 165 mpc z  0
037 as reported in glade see fig
 5 
 9 the angular separation between the center of the localization region and the nearby galaxy is at the 2
21σ-level relative to the formal fit error which is slightly less conservative than the quoted 90 localization derived from snr and is consistent with expectations of angular offsets from a host galaxy at that distance 
 we did not find any gw signal associated to grb 190610a in the data available from the two ligo detectors virgo data was not in observing mode at that particular time
 our modelled search described in sec
 3
1 which uses an on-source window from −5 s to 1 s around the grb trigger time placed 90 confidence exclusion distances of 63 mpc 82 mpc and 114 mpc for bns binaries with generically oriented spins nsbh binaries with generically oriented spins and aligned spin nsbh binaries see sec

1 for more details on these three populations
 in general a distance of 165 mpc can be within the reach of our modelled search but grb 190610a was in a sky location such that the sensitivity of both detectors was less than 30 of what it would have been in an optimal sky location
we carried out targeted analyses for gws associated to fermi and swift grbs reported during the o3a ligo-virgo observing run
 in the case of short and ambiguous grbs events see sec
 2 we ran a modelled search for ns binary merger signals harry  fairhurst 2011 williamson et al
 2014  while an unmodelled search for gw transient signals was performed for all grbs sutton et al
 2010 was et al
 2012 
 as a result of our analyses we found no gw signal in association with the grbs that we followed up
 this is consistent with the previously predicted rate of coincident detections of 0
1-1
4 per year for the third observing run of advanced ligo and advanced virgo abbott et al
 2017a 
 additionally by carrying out a weighted binomial test we found no strong evidence for a population of unidentified subthreshold gw signals in our results
 we set lower bounds on the distances to the progenitors of all grbs we analyzed for a number of emission models
 these d 90 values are reported in table 3  along with other information about each grb that we considered this includes timing sky location observing instrument and gw detectors with available data
 the 90 confidence level exclusion distances achieved in this run include the largest values published so far for some individual grbs cfr
 abbott et al
 2017c abbott et al
  2019b 
 among the grbs we analyzed is grb 190610a the sky localization of which included a nearby galaxy at a luminosity distance of 165 mpc
 we placed 90 confidence level exclusion distances lower than this value for ns binary merger gw signals and are therefore unable to rule out the possibility that grb 190610a happened in such galaxy

 1 2 approximately 25 of children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant hsct will develop a lrti
 1 3 improving detection of pathogens from bal specimens is critical to guide antimicrobial management direct infection prevention and control strategies understand potential changes in epidemiology and avoid more invasive diagnostic interventions for example lung biopsy
 prior studies of bal performed in immunocompromised children have reported detection of pathogens in 28-68 mean 50 of procedures using a variety of case definitions and patient populations
 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 however few recent studies have examined the diagnostic yield of bal in the immunocompromised pediatric population and compared the yield of different diagnostic assays
thus the primary aim of this study was to determine the overall diagnostic yield of bals in immunocompromised children over the past decade and to compare the rates of isolation of bacterial fungal viral and mycobacterial pathogens in the early 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 versus later 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 years of the study period
 we hypothesized that the diagnostic yield of bals performed in the earlier years of the study would be lower than bals performed during the later years due to improvements in diagnostic assays
 the secondary aim was to determine if bal results were associated with changes in antimicrobial therapy
a retrospective case series of immunocompromised pediatric patients undergoing bal from 2001 to 2012 was performed at newyork-presbyterian morgan stanley childrens hospital columbia university medical center new york new york
 the decision to perform bal was made by the patients primary team in consultation with the pediatric pulmonology service
 eligible subjects were 18 years of age at the time of bal and had multiple underlying diagnoses table 1 
 to identify cases the bal procedure records of the pediatric pulmonology division were reviewed
 if a subject underwent more than one bal during the study period all procedures were included
 flexible bronchoscopy was performed to obtain bal specimens in patients who were intubated endotracheally or less commonly via laryngeal mask airway lma
 sites for bal were chosen based on chest imaging usually ct scan and by findings at the time of bronchoscopy
 bal was performed at multiple sites if there were multiple areas of involvement on imaging or by bronchoscopic appearance
 the institutional review board of columbia university medical center approved the conduct of this study with a waiver of informed consent
the results of all microbial studies performed on each bal were reviewed including bacterial cultures fungal cultures afb smear and culture and viral diagnostic studies cultures direct fluorescence assay dfa  andor enzyme-linked immunoassays eias  and polymerase chain reaction pcr

 intravenous and inhaled antimicrobial agents and adjunctive agents for example cmv-or rsv-specific immunoglobulin were collected
doses of antimicrobials were reviewed to differentiate prophylactic from treatment regimens
the emr notes of the patients primary team or intensive care team were reviewed to determine the rationale for changes in antimicrobial therapy
 antimicrobial therapy was categorized as targeted or non-targeted
 targeted therapy was defined as antimicrobials that treated an identified bacterial pathogen based on susceptibility results
 non-targeted therapy was defined as antimicrobials that did not treat an identified pathogen or that were continued for a negative bal

demographic and clinical characteristics were collected from the emr
 in patients who underwent autologous hsct followed by a planned allogeneic hsct the date and degree of myeloablation 13 of the first hsct were used in the analysis
 radiographic findings suggestive of lrti for example nonspecific opacities nodules and ground glass opacities were abstracted from attending radiologists electronic reports of computed tomography ct performed within 10 days of bal when available or chest radiographs if a recent ct had not been performed
 radiographic findings reported for 5 of subjects i

in this study we describe a large cohort of immunocompromised children who underwent bal over a 12-year period and found that the infectious diagnostic yield of bal was 31
 we did not identify demographic or clinical risk factors associated with detection of a potential pathogen
 subjects who had undergone hsct andor who had received more myeloablative conditioning regimens were not more likely to have a detectable pathogen
 however radiographic findings of nonspecific opacities ground glass opacities and nodules were more likely to be associated with isolation of a potential pathogen the presence of such findings may therefore have clinical utility in the decision to perform bal in immunocompromised children
the rate of positive bals in previous studies has ranged from 28 to 68 as shown in table  4  4-57-1014-16 and this variability likely reflects institutional differences in patient populations bal testing modalities and local epidemiology of pathogens
 4 14 perhaps more importantly the case definitions for pathogenic microorganisms has varied in contrast to the current study some studies have included cons and mixed commensal flora as pathogenic
 4 5 yet others have variously excluded isolates of cmv candida spp
 ntm and aspergillus spp
 as airway contaminants
 4 6 9 contrary to our hypothesis the rate of isolation of potential pathogens was higher in the earlier years of the study than in later years although not statistically significant despite the fact that significantly more samples were submitted for fungal and cmv cultures in the later study period
 our results indicate that the majority of patients were on multiple antimicrobials at the time of bal and this may have affected culture results
 additionally during the last two decades isolation of viral microorganisms from bal has decreased overall 5 15 which may reflect improving antiviral prophylaxis in patients who are cmvseropositive
 the decreasing incidence of pneumocystis pneumonia due to prophylaxis against this organism is also well documented
 17 furthermore negative bals may have reflected non-infectious causes of lower tract disease such as graft-versushost disease or pulmonary fibrosis as has been previously described
 2 10 16 18 19 recent comparison studies have suggested that lung biopsy may elucidate noninfectious diagnoses in a manner superior to that of bal 20 21 22 though this procedure is associated with higher morbidity and mortality than bal
our study supports the observations made in prior series that a positive result from bal impacts treatment decisions
 4 8 20 we found that most negative bals were associated with discontinuing at least one non-targeted antimicrobial although often another non-targeted agent was continued
 in addition the majority of positive bals were associated with changing to targeted antimicrobials for viral or mycobacterial pathogens
 thus prescribing was improved following 119 68
4 of 174 bals
this single center retrospective study had limitations
 not all diagnostic tests were performed for every bal and we were unable to consistently determine the reason for this
 we also did not examine whether indication for bronchoscopy e
g
 fever worsening respiratory status radiographic findings was associated with detection of potential pathogens
 furthermore we could not assess the usefulness of rt-pcr for respiratory viral pathogens as our institution introduced this technology in may 2012 nor could we assess the usefulness of aspergillus galactomannan as so few tests were sent
 furthermore quantitative bal analysis was unavailable during the study period
 the study was not sufficiently powered to detect the association of relapse refractory disease type of chemotherapy or different conditioning regimens on the yield of bals
 we did not analyze the association of neutropenia with the yield of bal or with radiographic findings
 finally we could not conclusively determine providers rationale for continuing non-targeted therapy or discontinuing targeted therapy
bal contributes to treatment decision-making in immunocompromised patients with presumed lrti and continues to have a role in the care of this population
 a multicenter study should be performed to validate a case definition for positive bals to examine the relative contribution of newer diagnostic modalities and to further assess the impact of bals on antimicrobial management

 should they not make contact by the specified time a member of the research team will contact the volunteer
 if no contact is made then a prior defined secondary contact will be telephoned
the study primary outcomes are carriage at 48 hours andor 7days in inoculated volunteers
 this will be determined by culture of the 48 hour -7 day nasal wash sample
secondary endpoints are immunological parameters and further bacterial carriage characterisation
 in particular innate humoral and cellular responses to pneumococcal proteins and polysaccharide measured in serum saliva nasal wash
cellular responses -nasal washings saliva and bal will be examined by giemsa stained cytospin for recruitment of neutrophils
 in addition the number of macrophages and the apoptotic fraction of these macrophages will be determined if possible
 it may be possible to use transcriptomic techniques to examine cellular rna if whole cell analyses are not possible
 some immunoglobulin responses may alter adhesion or be anti-inflammatory
 antigen specific cd4 t cell responses are critical in defence against pneumococcal carriage 2 in animal models
 we will determine these responses in nasal wash if possible above and bal samples using multi-parameter flow cytometry 4 
 we will compare volunteers baseline and post-carriage observations to determine response to carriage
 none of these methods are clinically validated and so we will use conventional techniques to determine the primary endpoint
 we will also characterise the dynamics of co-colonisation particularly of s
pneumoniae with staphylococci and haemophilus spp in collaboration with emory university
pneumococcus is responsible for infections including otitis media om sinusitis pneumonia bacteraemia and meningitis
 the milder forms of infection om sinusitis are many times more common than the serious invasive forms of disease

hypotheses regarding bacterial co-colonisation will be tested using molecular techniques
 b new information regarding mucosal responses and bacterial colonisation with direct application to mucosal vaccine development
00ec586d591bfbe2f07a1322fe6501addac51798   pneumococcal disease is preceeded by colonisation of the nasopharynx of uninfected adults and children
 asymptomatic colonisation may be followed by carriage which remains asymptomatic or may rarely progress to disease
 most episodes of carriage result in improved immunity to future infection without the development of disease
 as such the mechanisms by which carriage is established the immunity that results from carriage and the mechanisms that determine when carriage ends are all of critical importance in the design of mucosal vaccines against pneumococcal disease
although there are many studies measuring natural pneumococcal carriage rates and serotypes in humans there are very limited data on the immune response to pneumococcal carriage in humans because the timing of any natural carriage episode is difficult to determine
 experimental human pneumococcal carriage has been safely established in two previous studies
 6 7 from these studies it is known that a variable proportion of those subjects inoculated with pneumococci become colonised
 the variables determining carriagenon-carriage following inoculation are unclear
 the rate of colonisation following nasal inoculation in these studies was reported as 50 with a duration of carriage between 21 and 122 days
 the immune response in nasal washings and serum showed an association between humoral responses to protein and polysaccharide antigens and carriage
 the humoral and cellular responses in the lung that result in response to nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage have not been described
murine studies have identified a number of pneumococcal proteins on the cell surface that induce antibodies in the host including pneumococcal surface protein a pspa pneumococcal surface adhesion a psaa and choline binding protein a cbpa also called pspc
 these proteins are common to the cell surface of all pneumococci
 in addition pneumolysin ply is a cytoplasmic protein also expressed by all pneumococci
 these surface and cytoplasmic proteins are both highly immunogenic and humoral responses confer protection against both invasive disease and carriage in mice 8 9 10 11 12 
 pre-existing antibody to cell wall polysaccharide has been demonstrated to be predictive of resistance to colonisation 6 7 
 susceptibility to carriage does not appear to correlate with pre-existing levels of immunoglobulin g igg to the specific capsular polysaccharide
 a rise in specific antibodies to protein cbpa and pspa during human carriage has also been demonstrated 6 7 
it has been demonstrated that mice lacking effective t-cell function have an increased duration of pneumococcal colonisation following inoculation suggesting that further examination of the cellular immune response to colonisation may provide useful information 13 
 mucosal t lymphocytes are critical in the regulation of mucosal defence
 recent data have emphasized the importance of both humoral responses and th17 subsets of cd4 lymphocytes in mucosal defence in murine model 14 15 
 our group has recently demonstated the upregulation of th17 lymphocytes in human lung following ehpc
 up-regulation of th17 antigen-specific cells is consistent with enhanced protection against pneumonia this could be tested in future by observing the association between th17 response and vaccine protection against a pneumococcal challenge
this study will address important current questions including dose dependency to establish pneumococcal carriage in human subjects the immune response in the lower airway to nasal carriage and innate humoral and cellular responses in both mucosal and systemic compartments
 we have previously demonstrated these responses to polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines 16 17 18 
 examination of individuals pre and post pneumococcal carriage and comparison between the immune response of colonised against un-colonised subjects will provide new information on the innate cellular and humoral immune responses to pneumococcal colonisation
 in future this model will be used in testing the effect of new candidate vaccines
 a major roadblock identified in the process of developing new protein vaccines has been a means of down-selecting from among the candidate antigen combinations proposed as vaccines -the ehpc model offers a means of doing just this by testing the effectiveness of candidate vaccines in blocking subsequent ehpc
we will carry out a dose-ranging study using 10 experimental carriage volunteers at each of 6 test doses and construct a dose-response curve b prospectively test the reproducibility and confidence interval associated with 50-80 carriage using lot quality assurance sampling lqas c vaccine effect testing
dose-ranging study -healthy volunteer adults will be screened to exclude subjects at risk of disease or subjects in contact with others at risk
 recruited volunteers will be screened for native pneumococcal carriage by nasal wash
 natural carriage volunteers will be excluded from inoculation but continue with the rest of the study as per experimental carriage volunteers
 120 experimental carriage subjects will then be recuited in groups of 10 subjects
 up to 40 natural carriage volunteers will be recruited
 each group of 10 experimental carriage subjects will be inoculated with 0
1ml pneumococci to each nostril
 the inoculated doses will be increased in each cohort of ten subjects from the initial cohort 1x10 4 cfunostril to 2x10 4  4x10 4  8x10 4  1
6x10 5  3
2x10 5 cfunostril
 we plan to recruit up to 20 participants to receive an inoculation of 0
9 saline solution to provide a control arm
 we will use the data to construct a graph of the carriage rate achieved with each inoculum dose
 the full dose ranging study will be done with serotype 6b and the repeated with serotype 23fboth of these types have been used in our pilot studies
the primary endpoint in each subject will be the detection of pneumococci by classical culture methods in nasal wash at 48hrs andor 7-10 days following inoculation
 the dose-response curve will then be used to tailor future vaccine assessment studies to purpose
 predicted 80 carriage will allow the ehpc model to have high sensitivity for vaccine efficacy with small study numbers
 the dose-response curve will also allow prediction of a 50 endpoint that will allow the combined testing for benefit and harm in future vaccine studies but at the cost of larger study numbers
the secondary endpoints are immunological assays to determine defence against infection
 we will collect samples in order to apply these assays to nasal wash saliva bronchoalveolar lavage urine throat swabs and blood before and after experimental challenge
 this will provide data on the density of colonisation as well as upper and lower airway innate humoral and cellular defence
 these data will allow us to define the host variables that predict ehpc reproducibility
 for example it may be that subjects with pre-existing high levels of anti-capsular igg or innate factors are resistant to ehpc and a future highly reproducible model may have to exclude these subjects at screening
reproducibility study -we will recruit 30 experimental carriage volunteers for each of the 2 serotypes
 a target carriage rate will be chosen from the dose ranging study and using the dose and protocol refined in that study simple reproducibility will be assessed by obtaining a confidence interval for the mean carriage
 using more complex data carriage density duration lqas 19 analysis can be applied
 lqas allows each sample to be defined as acceptable or unacceptable within a range of values and the hypothesis that the ratio of acceptableunacceptable is the same can be tested in the most parsimonious manner together with an estimate of the predictive value of this estimate
 lqas combines modelling with hypothesis testing and is directly applicable to the vaccine down-selection planned later
we will re-challenge volunteers successfully colonized in the reproducibility study with either the homologous or heterologous serotype using the same protocol re-challenge protocol to determine within serotype and across-serotype protection
 this is optional to the volunteer
we will inoculate natural carriers that were recruited during the study with the 6b strain to determine within serotype and across-serotype protection accounting for the previous natural serotype
 this will be performed according to the re-challenge protocol however this will include those volunteers that were previously removed from the study due to natural carriage
 the 2-6month interval will be counted from the termination of study in those that were previously removed from the study due to natural carriage or from completion of study in all other natural carriers
 this is optional to the volunteer
the study aims to investigate the innate acquired humoral and cellular immune response to induced pneumococcal nasal carriage in a safe and controlled manner
 we will carry out a dose-ranging study with type 6b and 23f pneumococci in order to find the optimal dose for 50-80 carriage with each serotype n10 experimental carriage subjects per dose range
 we will then test the hypothesis that we have achieved 50-80 carriage using lot quality assurance statistics in 2 prospective test sets n30 experimental carriage subjects per test set to ensure reproducibility
 we will re-challenge carriers with pneumococci to determine the protective effect of experimental human pneumococcal carriage ehpc itself as a surrogate for vaccine induced immunity
 we will describe the mechanisms underlying ehpc -protection from carriage
three major applications of this study are a as an immunological probe of mucosal immunity in the upper and lower airway b as a mucosal vaccine model and c as a potential surrogate of protection for testing novel protein vaccines with the eventual goal of a needle-free inhaled vaccine against s
 pneumoniae
we will inoculate healthy non-smoking adult volunteers with a well-characterised penicillin-sensitive pneumococcus 23f or 6b and observe the volunteers for the development of pneumococcal carriage
 colonisation may be expected to occur in 50-80 of the group while the remainder will clear the inoculum in a few hours

advertisements will be placed on physical notice boards in public areas and on the intranet of liverpool university and rlbuht as well as in the local press inviting healthy volunteers to participate
 interested persons are asked to contact the research team for further information and an initial appointment will be made should they wish to consider participating
adults aged 18-60 yrs -ages chosen to minimise the risk of pneumococcal infection unable to give fully informed consentclinical examination -the initial clinic visit will include a focused clinical history and targeted clinical examination involving auscultation of the lung fields and heart sounds
 should a previously unrecognised abnormality be identified this will be explained to the individual who will be informed they will be excluded from enrolling in the study and appropriate follow up and investigation will be arranged through the general practitioner
saliva samples -will be collected as per timetabled protocol above including the first clinic visit
 samples will be collected using salivates retained for 2 minutes between the gum and buccal mucosa as per the manufacturers instructions
nasal lavage -will be performed using a modified naclerio method 1 
 this is a well used and validated technique to collect nasal cytology specimens with which we now have 2 years experience
 briefly 10ml of saline is instilled and held for a few seconds in the nares before being expelled in to a petri dish
 in the event of nasal wash loss defined as coughsneezeswallow the procedure may then be repeated to obtain an adequate specimen
 should this initial wash demonstrate that a potential volunteer is already colonised with pneumococci they will follow the study but without inoculation
bloodvenous blood will be taken by an appropriately trained team member
 in the standard visits up to 40ml of blood will be collected for extraction of serum and whole blood an edta sample will be taken on the screening visit to determine normal range of white cell count
 in the enriched sample sets 2 paxgene tubes each 5ml will be collected on the additional days but the 40ml draw will only occur on the standard days
 volunteers will therefore give 40ml per week normally or 80ml in week 1 and 50 ml in week 2 in the enriched sampling
a viral throat swab will be obtained to assess viral load and viral co-infections in individuals who are colonised and not colonised following inoculation
 samples will be taken pre and 48 hours post pneumococcal inoculum to investigate the relationship between upper respiratory tract viral infections and susceptibility and density of pneumococcal colonisation
 in brief the individuals tongue will be depressed using a tongue depressor exposing the palatopharyngeal arch
 a sample will be obtained by making 5 small circular motions of the right palatopharyngeal in contact with the mucosa whilst avoiding the patients tongue
 the swab will be returned to the respective container and viral multiplex pcr will be used to evaluate the presence of flu a flu b rsv hmpv paraflus 1-4 adenovirus rhinovirus and coronaviruses oc43 229e nl63 and hku1
preparation of bacteria for carriage studies -mid-log broth culture of pneumococcus type 23f or 6b will be frozen at -80°c in aliquots of glycerol-enriched media
 frozen aliquots will be thawed and checked for cfuml e-test penicillin susceptibility and purity
 these checks will first be carried out in our laboratory and then identification and characterisation will be confirmed in a reference laboratory
 on experimental days aliquots will be thawed washed twice and re-suspended at an appropriate density for each inoculation dose
inoculation -using a p200 micropipette 0
1ml broth containing the desired dose ranging from 1x10 4 to 3
2x10 5 cfunostril of type 23f or 6b pneumococcus will be instilled
 patient will be seated in a semirecumbent position
 after inoculation patient will remain in this position for up to 15mins
 patient will be given post-inoculation advice sheet including emergency contact details thermometer amoxicillin and a daily symptom log to be completed by the participant
determination of colonisation -colonisation will be defined by the result of nasal washes taken at 48hrs and 7 days post inoculation
 nasal washes will be plated on to culture media and incubated overnight at 37°c in 5 co2
 colonies will be confirmed as s
 pneumoniae using classical techniques including i typical draughtsman-like colony morphology ii the presence of α-haemolysis iii optochin sensitivity ivsolubility in bile salts and v gram-positive diplococci
 typing by quellung reaction will be done using a typing kit with specific sera to confirm inoculated pneumococcal types
 isolates will be frozen at -80ºc for storage and reference laboratory confirmation
 results from the cultured nasal wash will also be confirmed using pcr based methods of bacterial detection
monitoring of colonisation -monitoring of colonisation will be done by weekly nasal washes reproducibility study
 home monitoring will include a symptom check-list with a clear flow chart of the necessary intervention should any symptoms develop see patient information sheet
 a three day course of amoxicillin will be issued on enrolment
 participants will be required to make text message contact with a specified member of the research team before 1400hrs every day until study completion
 should they not make contact by the specified time a member of the research team will contact the volunteer
 if no contact is made then a prior defined secondary contact will be telephoned
 during the post inoculation period volunteers will have access to a 247 on-call telephone service until after the end of the study
all study participants who are still carrying pneumococcus at the end of the study will take amoxicillin 500mg tds for 3 days orally at the end of the study
the study primary outcomes are carriage at 48 hours andor 7days in inoculated volunteers
 this will be determined by culture of the 48 hour -7 day nasal wash sample
secondary endpoints are immunological parameters and further bacterial carriage characterisation
 in particular innate humoral and cellular responses to pneumococcal proteins and polysaccharide measured in serum saliva nasal wash
soluble factors -serum saliva nasal wash supernatant and bal supernatant will be assayed for antimicrobial peptides such as slpi lysozyme lactoferrin ll-37 and beta defensins as well as neutrophil recruiting chemokines such as cxcl-1 2 and their receptors and cxcl-8 il-8 slpi
cellular responses -nasal washings saliva and bal will be examined by giemsa stained cytospin for recruitment of neutrophils
 in addition the number of macrophages and the apoptotic fraction of these macrophages will be determined if possible
 nb the cellular fraction of nasal wash is highly variable and many samples may have inadequate cellular material for analysis
 it may be possible to use transcriptomic techniques to examine cellular rna if whole cell analyses are not possible
humoral immunoglobulin specific levelsincluding anti-capsule and anti-protein pspa psaa pspc ply igg and iga will be examined by elisa as well as opsonophagocytic activity opa
 some immunoglobulin responses may alter adhesion or be anti-inflammatory
 we will collaborate with cdc atlanta to optimise ig response measurement using luminex hence parsimonious use of sample and then develop both adhesion and avidity assays to determine immunoglobulin function
differential cell counts will be performed by cytospin on all nasal washes and bal samples before and after pneumococcal carriage to confirm the absence of inflammation
 antigen specific cd4 t cell responses are critical in defence against pneumococcal carriage 2 in animal models
 we will determine these responses in nasal wash if possible above and bal samples using multi-parameter flow cytometry 4 
 in particular we will determine the cd4 th1th2 ratio and gate on memory cd4 t cells to examine the percentage of antigen specific cells against cell free supernatant from the pneumococcus culture broth
 a proliferation index cfse staining activation cd154 signal and cytokine profile ifn gamma il-4 tnf and il-2 of the specific cells can be determined to interrogate the functional quality of the responsive cells including regulatory t cell responses
 we will compare volunteers baseline and post-carriage observations to determine response to carriage
 we will then compare volunteers with carriage to non-carriage subjects to determine the type of t cell response that is associated with eradication of carriage
 cellular defence t cell proliferation by cfse intracellular cytokine staining following antigen stimulation will be measured in peripheral blood and bal if available
molecular techniques will be employed to determine the carriage density primers including lyta of pneumococcus and other nasopharyngeal and lower airway microbiota
 modern techniques include 16srdna typing deep sequencing with 454 technology and transcriptomic profiling in collaboration with liverpool university imperial college wt sanger institute u penn or univ nijmegen
 none of these methods are clinically validated and so we will use conventional techniques to determine the primary endpoint
 we will also characterise the dynamics of co-colonisation particularly of s

pneumococcus is responsible for infections including otitis media om sinusitis pneumonia bacteraemia and meningitis

 while the risk to individuals of developing any infection is very low 10 adults experience colonisation at any time and the incidence of invasive disease is 20100 000 patient years the study is designed to ensure any risk is minimal by appropriate - the dmsc will receive a weekly update on all recruitment by email and will meet by telephone conference in the event of any adverse events
 a face to face meeting will be arranged after the dose-ranging studies to make recommendations
we have experience of over 1000 of these procedures and have published an audit of volunteer experience in the journal of medical ethics
 we have a full risk assessment that can be provided as separate documents but in summary we have had a low complication rate mild symptoms in less than 25 subjects and no serious adverse events
the primary endpoint of carriage will be plotted as a rate against dose and a dose-carriage plot used to predict 50 and 80 carriage if reached
 using a target carriage rate lqas methods will be used to test the confidence limits of the protocol in a reproducibility study
immunological parameters will all be compared against pre-exposure values where possible in paired analyses using parametric or non-parametric tests as appropriate
 in the case of bal data we will only have one sample and therefore and will test hypotheses against test values and by non-paired comparison between groups e
g
 carriersnon-carriers
 for example in current studies we know that the percentage of antigen-specific t cells does not exceed 1 in normal subjects in the absence of carriage
hypotheses regarding bacterial co-colonisation will be tested using molecular techniques
 these methods are inherently semi-quantitative and so evaluation will be by comparison of proportions in samples at different time points and between subject groups
 we will be advised by dr brian faragher and professor joe valadez in the complex analyses planned in this study
success in this project will result in a a robust ehpc protocol that can be used in novel vaccine evaluation
 b new information regarding mucosal responses and bacterial colonisation with direct application to mucosal vaccine development
 future work will be planned to build on both of these anticipated outcomes by engaging with vaccine manufacturing companies and mucosal adjuvant programmes

are you changing your approach to initial inductionthere is a controversy about the use of steroids a key part of induction therapy
if the physician considers that the patient is at high risk of complications we recommend a multidisciplinary discussion and  or with the coordinators of the protocol with a view to considering reductions in dose or in the number of administrations of certain drugs including potentially steroids
 once all the induction chemotherapy has been administered the use of g-csf in a covid  patient can be discussed to reduce the duration of neutropenia
the implementation of all or part of treatment on an outpatient basis must be carefully weighed
 indeed the comings and goings to the ambulatory clinic and blood samplings at home increase the number of contacts at risk
 conversely return at home could limit contact with caregivers also possibly contaminated
in most hospitals visits are limited to only parents with only one parent present at a time

 any specific treatment must be discussed with the infectious disease team
they are described in table 1 aiming to list some of the treatments with antiviral potential and some of those proposed to act against the inflammatory process
 of note the inflammatory stage of covid19 infection is generally the one of aggravation and often involves hospitalization in icu

 duck-hee kang is an associate professor at the university of alabama at birmingham school of nursing birmingham alabama
 prapim buddhirakkul is a doctoral student and faculty of nursing this is an interesting and provocative paper
 lee and her international colleagues 1 clearly challenge other nurses and nurse researchers to take up a global perspective for exploring healthcare issues and join the force to improve the health of people across the nations
 the globalization of the world is a reality
 it is not a new concept
 while nurses form the cornerstone of the healthcare teams nurses have not taken a leadership role in global healthcare issues or in moving forward with active programs of international collaborative work and research
 international collaborations in healthcare research are particularly lacking between eastern and western countries
 only a handful of nurse researchers have begun to take an initiative in this venue
 similarities as well as differences in healthcare issues healthcare delivery systems environmental sociocultural and economical factors and health behaviors and health policies both at the population and individual levels for example can form a rich ground for mutual learning in solving common healthcare problems between the nations
 many healthcare issues are no longer an isolated problem confined to a certain nation or region of the world
 as the entire world is within one-day traveling distance a health problem in one region or nation can quickly spread to the other regions and nations in a very short time period
 a recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is a very good example of such healthcare crises that demand rapid and efficient solutions via active international collaborations
 beyond such unexpected and sporadic outbreaks of illnesses and diseases a more fundamental issue is how nurses and nurse researchers should think out-ofthe-box and out of the one-locality and one-nation mind set
 nurses need to think beyond the boundaries
working together across the nations should be a norm rather than an exception
 when and why does a certain healthcare system succeed or fail in a given nation or locality what lessons can we gain from each others trials and errors what are the major factors that may significantly influence public health in a given nation or region and how can nurses be involved in identifying overcoming and correcting any shortcomings to improve public health what role can nurses and nurse researchers play in improving global health care across the nations how can we adopt and remodel successful programs of health care from one nation to another to best serve target populations these are some basic questions nurses and nurse researchers should pursue
 health promotion disease prevention and health maintenance and restoration are a common goal for all human beings regardless of the origin of the race and the nation
 nurses and nurse researchers should take an active role in achieving these goals across the nations
 lee and colleagues 1 have taken an important initial step toward this goal by comparing the healthcare delivery systems and health outcomes between the two countries of korea and thailand
in a conceptual framework for globalization and health woodward et al 2 list several major constructs that influence the overall level and equity of health
 these constructs include the healthcare system national and personal economy health influences and risk factors at the population and individual levels along with other societal and political factors
 within the health care system the health care delivery system may drive the health service access health service quality and health service price
 as indicated in lee et als 1 article the two different healthcare delivery systems of korea and thailand with differential structural and resource allocation may lead to considerably different health outcomes
 despite similar demographic characteristics of the population between two countries and despite the fact that the gross national income is nearly 5 times higher for korea than for thailand the maternal and infant mortality rates are much higher in korea
 such success in thailand may be attributed to the healthcare delivery system built wisely and appropriately to serve people while keeping the health service price down
 as a clear example demonstrating the linkages between the health care delivery system and subsequent health outcomes it may be useful to further illustrate the thailand system in detail
the majority of people in thailand reside in rural areas where the traditional healthcare system may not sufficiently cover the cost of healthcare services for the poor
 the concept of primary health care was introduced in thailand over 2 decades ago interestingly modeled after a successful korean system developed to revitalize the pride and economy of every rural village in korea
 under this primary healthcare concept health care in thailand starts at the lowest village level
 when adequate care cannot be provided at that level then the sick seek the care at the next higher level of the care system moving from the village to subdistrict to district to provincial hospital level
 at the village level each village selects village health volunteers who can provide health information and basic care to their neighbors of 15-20 households
 these village health volunteers are trained and supervised by the technical nurses at the subdistrict health centers using the modules and manuals provided by the ministry of public health
 these modules and manuals are developed to fit the levels of village health volunteers for easy understanding and allow them to give their neighbors simple health information that is focused on nutrition sanitation maternal child health immunization mental health and so on
 this system is known as the grass root healthcare system in thailand
 the ministry of public health presents its continuous support by designating an annual national village health volunteer day and giving recognition to excellent village health volunteers
 placement of a midwife at each subdistrict health center is another example of making a difference in maternal and child health outcomes in thailand
this example highlights how systematic structures of a healthcare delivery system with specific targets on particular areas of health care can make a difference in health outcomes of the nation
 because the economy is a major interacting factor the healthcare delivery system needs to be built to increase health service access and quality while keeping the health service price down
 the effective mobilization and maintenance of the low cost healthcare system and easy access to healthcare services supported by the global national policy and structure might have been the keys to success demonstrated in thailand in lee et al
s article 1 
 more active healthcare research can be initiated at international levels by nurse researchers to explore effective means of improving public health across nations
 health out-comes however might also have been affected by several other factors beside the healthcare delivery system which have not been adequately addressed in lee et al
s article 1 perhaps largely due to the limitations in available databases
 one such salient factor affecting health outcomes is health behavior
health behaviors are a major determinant of health outcomes
 in woodard et al
s 2 globalization and health conceptualization health behaviors are conceptualized as an individual health risk factor that also can be influenced by socialcultural health influence at the population level
 as clearly illustrated in lee et al
s article 1 the high percentages of men smoking and drinking in korea are striking
 while the percentages of men smoking and drinking in thailand are not low the smoking rate is nearly double among korean men
 in contrast the percentage of men exercising in korea is a mere 9
9 approximately one third of the percentage of men exercising in thailand
 another clear concern is the considerable number of women drinking in korea
 although health outcome data are limited in specifics such as for the types of cancer mortality 1 the extent and duration of certain health behaviors and other confounding factors would have a major impact on various health outcomes
 this relationship is partly evidenced by the high mortality rate from cancer and cardiovascular diseases in koreans
there is an urgent need of further investigations
 nurses need to better understand the basis of such detrimental health behaviors in a particular sector of the world korean men in this case
 through international collaborations and communications the underlying reasons and potential strategies for interventions can be carefully explored
 detrimental health behaviors must be discouraged systematically while protective health behaviors need to be adopted at the national and individual levels
 lessons from other nations can ideally facilitate a more effective change process in another nation
 needless to say the strategies must be adopted to be socioculturally appropriate and economically sound for meeting the particular needs of a given nation
 however increased international collaborations and comparative analyses between and among nations on relevant health issues can substantially increase the efficiency and the likelihood of the success of the adopted programs
 further adopted programs must be implemented at the multidimensional levels targeting behavioral changes not only on the individual but also on the societal levels
in order for the programs to be successful it is also essential for nurses and nurse researchers to understand deeply embedded social cultures beforehand
 for example nurses must know that it is customary for a large proportion of korean men to eat dinner out with friends and colleagues after work nearly every weekday
 at the dinner table men smoke and share drinks
 in fact smoking and drinking are highly encouraged and pressure to conform to this behavior is common among members of the social groups
 for instance it is not polite for a man to refuse a drink or a cigarette when others particularly someone in higher power or a higher position offer such
 furthermore it is expected that those who receive the offer return the favor thus continuing a vicious cycle of more smoking and more drinking
 when such behavior largely constitutes male socialization and bonding those who do not smoke and drink tend to fall outside the social circle often feeling left out and isolated
 a positive note in such a seemingly destructive social culture is that this is an effective means for korean men to disperse their daily stress from a highly competitive society
 thus understanding cultural aspects is a critical step for any international collaboration
 in such a social climate it will be extremely difficult to change individuals behaviors without concurrent changes in the societal attitude and norm
 to this end national healthcare policy and societalcultural changes need to be planned over time using a step-by-step systematic approach to facilitate the success
negative health behaviors can result in direct economic consequences for the society
 kang et al
 3 estimated the economic burden of smoking in korea using two different approaches disease specific and all causes approaches
 based on the major data source of the korea medical insurance corporation cohort study the authors estimated the costs of smoking to range from 0
59 to 1
19 of gross domestic product equivalent to 4
89-9
86 million per 100000 people
 in addition to being an economic burden smoking in korea is found to be a major independent risk factor of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases even in a population that has relatively low levels of serum cholesterol
 4 fortunately however there is a recent movement for changes in smoking behaviors in korea
 because of increasing public awareness national policies are being implemented to curtail smoking in korea
 the smoking areas are clearly designated and separated from non-smoking areas in all public buildings and more strict regulations are expected in the near future to restrict smoking
 in contrast the rate of drinking both in men and women remains high in korea despite the high incidence rates of liver malignancies and diseases
 similarly exercise is another major health behavior that needs to be actively promoted and endorsed for beneficial effects on health outcomes
 although societal attitude has become much more enthusiastic about exercisephysical activity since the olympics in seoul korea in 1988 the society needs to embrace beneficial health behaviors more quickly and actively
 this is a clear national example that demonstrates how culture intersects with societal health behaviors that can have a significant impact on health outcomes
seeman and crimmins 5 discussed the effects of social environment on health
 major health behaviors known to impact various health outcomes such as smoking drinking exercise physical activity as well as dietnutrition need to be examined and compared across nations
 effective strategies for endorsing beneficial health behaviors can be implemented concurrently at the individual and population levels with adequate allocation of resources and infrastructures
 often history tends to repeat
 history in one nation can be a current reality in another nation
 through active international collaborations as demonstrated by lee et al 1 nurses and nurse researchers can make significant contributions to minimizing unnecessary repetition of an unsuccessful history by facilitating an adoption of effective strate-gies for changing health behaviors that are culturally appropriate
nurses and nurse researchers have a major role in public health promotion disease prevention and maintenance and restoration of health
 in particular nurses can make a significant impact on health promotion and disease prevention
 health education is an essential basic means of promoting health and preventing diseases
 through public education nurses can contribute to changing the health behaviors and self-care practices of the public
 the people in the community for example can be educated without delay when they need to seek healthcare
 appropriate care-seeking behaviors participation in screening and preventive measures and effective utilization of the healthcare system in turn are related to healthcare access
 as illustrated in lee et al
s 1 article the heathcare system in thailand seems to have been structured to facilitate easy access to healthcare by people in the community who are most likely underprivileged and poor
 by utilizing village health volunteers at the village level the thailand system seems to facilitate easy dissemination of basic health information and basic care to people in need thus making an impact on health promotion and disease prevention at an early stage
 in this regard technical nurses at the subdistrict level have the major responsibility of training these village health volunteers as the workforce in the frontline for health promotion and disease prevention
in the past technical nurses at health centers at the subdistrict level in thailand were graduates from a 2-year school of nursing sponsored by the ministry of public health
 most of these nurses receive scholarships from the ministry of public health and go back to work at health centers
 however more recently these technical nurses have been highly encouraged to continue their education to obtain a bachelors degree in nursing
 at the same time the ministry of public health is advocating that all of their schools of nursing be nursing and midwifery colleges to better prepare nurses at health centers to promote maternal child health and prevent diseases
 this bottom-up approach from the lowest healthcare level to the highest coincides with greater emphasis on the nurses role in health promotion and disease prevention which can make substantial differences in health outcomes that are evident in low maternal and infant mortality rates in thailand
 1 nursing curriculum at the same time should be organized to prepare nurses adequately for health promotion and disease prevention
the use of complementary and alternative medicine cam is common practice particularly in the orient which can affect health outcomes
 certain healing remedies are handed down across many generations as traditional medicine
 although there was a transient movement to discourage the use of cam a more recent approach in many nations is to better understand basic mechanisms underlying the anticipated effects of cam and accept the use of cam more openly and efficiently in conjunction with western medicine
 for example the thai government and the ministry of public health are now trying to incorporate the wisdom of thai traditional and alternative medicine into health care of thai people
 the institute of thai traditional medicine was established under the ministry of public health in 1993 httpwww
ittm
or
thengittm history
htm to further develop thai traditional medicine
 similarly the use of cam is prevalent in korea and the studies of oriental medicine have been well established in the university setting for decades
 commonly used cam includes thai and korean traditional medicine herbal medicine massage acupuncture acupressure and aromatherapy to name a few
 in western nations vitamins and dietary supplements are commonly used
 given the frequent use of cam by the public and their potential impact on health outcomes future studies should also utilize a more systematic approach for understanding the use of cam and their impact on health outcomes across nations
various factors such as the healthcare delivery system healthcare access quality cost and health behaviors have a major impact on health outcomes
 with globalization of the world nurses and nurse researchers need to take an active leadership role to promote health and prevent diseases across nations
 by enhanced international collaborations and comparisons nurses can make significant contributions to improving global health
 selected strategies for improving health however need to be carefully revised to be socioculturally and economically appropriate for the people of the target
 lee et al 1 clearly demonstrate the importance of further international collaborations for a common goal of health

 data on 57 studies with 221195 participants were used for analysis
 the authors assessed the heterogeneity of effect size using the q statistic and the i2 statistics
 subgroup and sensitivity analysis was done including the assessment of publication bias
 nevertheless the studys findings need to be confronted with a rigorous analysis of the data
 justification for inclusion of the study has been clearly stated and the suggested statistical analysis looks rigorous
 while the statistical methods are outlined and justified clearly just how the study was designed could be explained further
 it is noticeable however that majority of studies are from china alone in the pooled studies
 however overall the pooled estimate of the random effects model is heavily influenced by china
 the projected findings may be largely aimed at china
 the english language restriction of the search criteria is also a major limitation of the study findings
 this conclusion is not supported by data and it is a mere speculation

 therefore the number of 210 countries cited by the authors is not correct
 we all really appreciate your potential and optimism while you give such constructive and in-depth comments
 below we have written the point to point response to issues you raised
 reviewer comment 1 general this is an interesting effort but i believe the conclusion the authors make is wrong
 the prevalence of covid-19 in symptomatic subjects who present to the erget tested is higher in males
 gender differences in patients with covid-19 focus on severity and mortality
 2020 apr 298152 and dangis a et al
 impact of gender on extent of lung injury in covid-19
 the prevalence of covid-19 in symptomatic subjects who present to the erget tested is higher in males
 the prevalence of covid -19 among tested and confirmed patients is also higher in males
 this might be due to most tested patients are symptomatic and males are more likely to be symptomatic
 in addition roles and behaviors which increase the risk of acquiring covid-19 are more prevalent in male
 food or pharmacy manufacturing and sales agriculture or food production and distribution transportation and logistics and security

 in results authors used term severe illness
 does that mean confirmed cases i thought it was easy to be mixed with critical ill case
 author response yes it was editorial mistake amended as per your comment page 7 line 124
 the description of how many individuals included in analysis and the definition of a covid-19 confirmed case are needed
 in presentation of publication bias i suggest author summarized the results from software rather than directly using the screen-capture
 in discussion the writing was too simple
 i suggest more explanation on how was the results supported by other findings e
 comment based on study quality author response we have re-write the discussion considering your and other reviewers comment
 we have tried to compare with other studies result finding

 this conclusion is not supported by data and it is a mere speculation
 authors response we have enriched the discussion by supporting our justification with dataprevious literatures in discussion
 this finding was also reported by other studies 9 10 
 a study in ontario canada showed that men were more likely to test positive 1 2 
 in pakistan 72 of covid-19 cases were male 11 
 food or pharmacy manufacturing and sales agriculture or food production and distribution transportation and security
 these increased levels of exposure makes males at high risk of acquiring covid-19 disease
4 times more likely than non-smokers to have severe symptoms of covid-19 12 
 men tended to develop more symptomatic and serious cases than women according to the clinical classification of severity
 women are in general able to mount a more vigorous immune response to infections and vaccinations 17 
 some previous studies on coronaviruses in mice have suggested that the hormone estrogen may have a protective role
 estrogens suppress the escalation phase of the immune response that leads to increased cytokine release 18 
 the x chromosome is known to contain the largest number of immune-related genes in the whole genome 15 
 thus womens immune systems are generally more responsive to infections
 thank you very much you have directed us a very important point regarding meta-regression
 univariate meta-regression analyses revealed that the prevalence of smoking was found to be high in males 
this contributed for high prevalence of covid-19 among males p0
021 and cardio vascular disease 0
001 were also found to be higher in males and these significantly increases the prevalence of covid-19
 besides higher proportion of severcritical illness 0
001 were also observed among males table 3

 the context is relevant the topic is extremely important as the outbreak of the pandemic of covid-19 constitute a health risk with economic impact on public health
 nevertheless the studys findings need to be confronted with a rigorous analysis of the data
major comments 4
 this is an important research topic and one that has potential to fill important knowledge gaps and contributes to the ongoing debate on the worldwide prevalence of the pandemic
 justification for inclusion of the study has been clearly stated and the suggested statistical analysis looks rigorous
 5 
 while the statistical methods are outlined and justified clearly just how the study was designed could be explained further
 it is noticeable however that majority of studies are from china alone in the pooled studies
 some thought has been given to conduct subgroup and sensitivity analysis eg sub-group by the study country and sample size
 however overall the pooled estimate of the random effects model is heavily influenced by china
 on the 57 studies only four studies are not from china coming from korea italy and japan with small sample size and the results run the risk of having only limited impact on policy and outcomes globally
 the projected findings may be largely aimed at china
 7 
 the english language restriction of the search criteria is also a major limitation of the study findings
 little effort was made by authors to consult other data sources and perhaps complement the published data with countries specific data worldwide
 for instance country specific data published by international organisations such who or ministry of health of specific countries or independent organisations httpswww
worldometers
infocoronaviruscoronavirus-age-sexdemographics could have been used to refine the estimates of the published data and to include more countries in the analysis
minor comments 8
 in the conclusion the authors argued that the male-female difference can be explained by hormonal and chromosomal variation between males and females and high prevalence of smoking and alcohol consumption among men
 this conclusion is not supported by data and it is a mere speculation
 the selected studies have this information a meta-regression analysis should be conducted to ascertain the effects of these factors on the prevalence
 9 
 they are also some inaccuracies in the text
 for instance page 4 line 58 the sentence reads so far 2019-ncov has affected more than 210 countries with 2 733591 confirmed cases…

 there are 195 countries in the world today
 this total comprises 193 countries that are member states of the united nations and 2 countries that are non-member observer states the holy see and the state of palestine
 therefore the number of 210 countries cited by the authors is not correct

infocoronaviruscoronavirus-age-sexdemographicsto reviewer 1 dear symons rolf reviewer we would like to forward our deep-seated gratitude for your interesting and valuable comments and helping us throughout the process
 we all really appreciate your potential and optimism while you give such constructive and in-depth comments
 since we have agreed with all of your points raised we believe we have amended the manuscript as per your comments
 we would like to thank you again since you are contributing for our better paper by giving such comments which is important to improve the quality of this paper
 below we have written the point to point response to issues you raised
 reviewer comment 1 general this is an interesting effort but i believe the conclusion the authors make is wrong
 the prevalence of covid-19 in symptomatic subjects who present to the erget tested is higher in males
 several studies have suggested a worse outcome for men with covid-19 and more extensive involvement on chest ct has been shown in males e
g
 jin jm et al
 gender differences in patients with covid-19 focus on severity and mortality
 frontiers in public health
 2020 apr 298152 and dangis a et al
 impact of gender on extent of lung injury in covid-19
 clinical radiology
 2020 apr 23
 the data the authors have does allow them to conclude covid-19 is more prevalent in symptomatic patients but as 90 of covid-19 subjects remains largely asymptomatic they cannot claim the prevalence of covid-19 is higher in males in general
 author response thank you very much dear for the resource you supplied and raised an interesting point regarding our conclusion
 the prevalence of covid-19 in symptomatic subjects who present to the erget tested is higher in males
 the prevalence of covid -19 among tested and confirmed patients is also higher in males
 this finding was also reported by other studies for instance a study in ontario canada showed that men were more likely to test positive and had higher rates of hospitalization icu admission and death 1 2 
 this might be due to most tested patients are symptomatic and males are more likely to be symptomatic
 in addition roles and behaviors which increase the risk of acquiring covid-19 are more prevalent in male
 male are more involved in different risky behaviors like alcohol consumption 3 4 5  key activities in burial rites as employees in basic sectors and occupations that continue being active and require them to work outside the home and interact with other people during the containment phase e
g
 food or pharmacy manufacturing and sales agriculture or food production and distribution transportation and logistics and security
 bc of such behaviors males mostly dont stay at home sit together remove their mask while they drink and smoke
 these increased levels of exposure makes males at high risk of acquiring covid-19 disease that is why it is more prevalent in male
 other literatures like global health 5050 data gathering the prevalence of covid-19 confirmed cases and the death rate due to covid-19 is high among males in different countries 6 7 8 
we have included such information in discussion part
 we have amended the conclusion as per your comment page 2 line 28 reviewer comment 2 background p337 sever - severe smoking and drinking alcohol reduce your overall health and therefore make you more susceptible to symptomatic covid-19 infection
 author response amended as per your comment page 10 line 2020-209 reviewer comment to conclude the effort is good but the conclusions are wrong
 complete overhaul and resubmission could be considered
 author response thank you very much again since we have extensively amended the paper to make it better than its previous submission because of you
to reviewer 2 dear weizhi liu reviewer we would like to forward our deep-seated gratitude for your interesting and valuable comments and helping us throughout the process
 we all really appreciate your potential and optimism while you give such constructive and in-depth comments
 since we have agreed with all of your points raised we believe we have amended the manuscript as per your comments
 we would like to thank you again since you are contributing for our better paper by giving such comments which is important to improve the quality of this paper
 below we have written the point to point response to issues you raised
 reviewer comment in all the manuscript is compact and clear
 it draws an important issue considering the sex difference in covid-19 pandemic which is critical reference for future polices and interventions
 however there were several limitations affecting the strength of the results
 there are mainly two concerns from my view lack of chinese database as mentioned in limitations i suggest collaborating with chinese scholars and inadequate analysis of source of heterogeneity since most of studies was in china subgroup by country was not enough
 authors could consider province study quality and sample size et al

 other comments are as follows author response we have consulted chines e scholar to the database and we used the data we get to compare our result in discussion part
 as a result we extensively enriched the discussion part
 thank you very much after your direction we have made subgroup analysis by province study quality and sample size and we found the pooled prevalence of covid- 19 supplementary fig 2

 reviewer comment 3
 the description of how many individuals included in analysis and the definition of a covid-19 confirmed case are needed
 author response • 57 studies with a total of 221195 patients were included in the analysis page 6 line 113 • we have also included the case definitions of covid-19 confirmed case detection of sars-cov-2 nucleic acid in a clinical specimen  possible case any person with at least one of the following symptoms  cough fever shortness of breath sudden onset of anosmia ageusia or dysgeusia probable case any person with at least one of the following symptoms  cough fever shortness of breath sudden onset of anosmia ageusia or dysgeusia with close contact with a confirmed covid-19 case in the 14 days prior to onset of symptom or having been a resident or a staff member in the 14 days prior to onset of symptoms in a residential institution for vulnerable people where ongoing covid-19 transmission has been confirmed page 5 line 96-101
 reviewer comment 5
 in presentation of publication bias i suggest author summarized the results from software rather than directly using the screen-capture
 author response we have summarized the publication bias result in text and removed the picture from the software and amended as per your comment page 8 line 147-148
 reviewer comment 6
 in discussion the writing was too simple
 i suggest more explanation on how was the results supported by other findings e
g
 comparisons with the results from other studies how did sex chromosomes influence the process of getting infectious disease what were possible source of bias e
g
 comment based on study quality author response we have re-write the discussion considering your and other reviewers comment

 we all really appreciate your potential and optimism while you give such constructive and in-depth comments
 since we have agreed with all of your points raised we believe we have amended the manuscript as per your comments
 we would like to thank you again since you are contributing for our better paper by giving such comments which is important to improve the quality of this paper
 below we have written the point to point response to issues you raised
 general comments the paper investigates the sex difference in the prevalence of coronavirus disease covid- 19 confirmed cases during the 2020 pandemic of covid-19 using published literature from 2019 to 2020
 a systematic review of the published literature pubmed cochrane library and google scholar and a random effect meta-analysis model were used to pool the overall prevalence of covid-19 by gender
 data on 57 studies with 221195 participants were used for analysis
 the authors assessed the heterogeneity of effect size using the q statistic and the i2 statistics
 subgroup and sensitivity analysis was done including the assessment of publication bias
 the context is relevant the topic is extremely important as the outbreak of the pandemic of covid-19 constitute a health risk with economic impact on public health
 nevertheless the studys findings need to be confronted with a rigorous analysis of the data

 i have the following queries and suggestions major comments reviewer comment  this is an important research topic and one that has potential to fill important knowledge gaps and contributes to the ongoing debate on the worldwide prevalence of the pandemic
 justification for inclusion of the study has been clearly stated and the suggested statistical analysis looks rigorous
 while the statistical methods are outlined and justified clearly just how the study was designed could be explained further

 the projected findings may be largely aimed at china
authors response yes you are correct due to lack of published papers from other countries at the beginning most of the published articles were from china
 in addition to assess the impact of sample size study quality and province we further conducted subgroup analysis by province sample size and study quality as we also directed by other revewers in addition to your concern
 thank you very much after your direction we have made subgroup analysis by province study quality and sample size and we found table 2 and supplementary fig 2

 we have presented this findings in the manuscript page 7 line 126-140 table 2  supplementary  figure 123 and 4  we have tried to discuss our result with other countries finding which were not included in to the analysis because of not fulfilling the inclusion criteria or due to quality appraisal process
 we have included this in limitation of the study as the pooled estimate may be influenced by china
 reviewer comment the english language restriction of the search criteria is also a major limitation of the study findings
 little effort was made by authors to consult other data sources and perhaps complement the published data with countries specific data worldwide
 for instance country specific data published by international organizations such who or ministry of health of specific countries or independent organizations httpswww
worldometers
infocoronaviruscoronavirus-age-sexdemographics could have been used to refine the estimates of the published data and to include more countries in the analysis
 authors response using only papers published in english were also our drawback that we included in limitation of the study
 however as you directed as we have used the country specific data published by international organizations such who or ministry of health of specific countries or independent organizations to compare and discus our result
 however those finding doesnt fulfill the quality appraisal checklist mainly because they lack a detail methodology which the appraisal checklist requires
 as a result we didnt include such findings in the pooled result rather we synthesize and discus this results considering your comment
 reviewer comment 8 in the conclusion the authors argued that the male-female difference can be explained by hormonal and chromosomal variation between males and females and high prevalence of smoking and alcohol consumption among men
 this conclusion is not supported by data and it is a mere speculation
 the selected studies have this information a meta-regression analysis should be conducted to ascertain the effects of these factors on the prevalence
 authors response we have enriched the discussion by supporting our justification with dataprevious literatures in discussion
 this finding was also reported by other studies 9 10 
 a study in ontario canada showed that men were more likely to test positive 1 2 
 in pakistan 72 of covid-19 cases were male 11 
 according to global health 5050 data gathering the number of covid-19 confirmed cases and the death rate due to covid-19 is high among males in different countries 6 7 8 
 this might be due to behavioral factors and roles which increase the risk of acquiring covid-19 tend to occur more among men
 male are more involved in different risky behaviors like alcohol consumption 3 4 5  key activities in burial rites as employees in basic sectors and occupations that continue being active and require them to work outside the home and interact with other people during the containment phase e
g
 food or pharmacy manufacturing and sales agriculture or food production and distribution transportation and security
 because of such behaviors males mostly dont stay at home sit together and remove their mask while they drink and smoke
 these increased levels of exposure makes males at high risk of acquiring covid-19 disease
 in china 50 of men in smoke but because it is not considered acceptable for women to smoke only 2 of them do so
smoking is associated with adverse outcomes of covid-19 for instance the combined results of five studies showed that smokers were 1
4 times more likely than non-smokers to have severe symptoms of covid-19 12 
 besides smoking is related to higher expression of ace2 the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 which might be the reason for the higher prevalence of covid-19 in this subgroup of patients than in women 13 
 men tended to develop more symptomatic and serious cases than women according to the clinical classification of severity
 similar occasions occurred during previous coronavirus epidemics men had worse outcomes of illness from severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 14 and a higher risk of dying from middle east respiratory syndrome mers 15 
 biological sex variation is said to be one of the reason for the sex discrepancy of covid-19 cases severity and mortality 16 
 women are in general able to mount a more vigorous immune response to infections and vaccinations 17 
 some previous studies on coronaviruses in mice have suggested that the hormone estrogen may have a protective role
 estrogens suppress the escalation phase of the immune response that leads to increased cytokine release 18 
 the authors showed that female mice treated with an estrogen receptor antagonist died at close to the same rate as the male mice 19 
 the x chromosome is known to contain the largest number of immune-related genes in the whole genome 15 
 with their xx chromosome women have a double copy of key immune genes compared to the single copy in xy men
 this boost extends to both the general reaction to infection the innate response and also to the more specific response to microbes including antibody formation adaptive immunity 15 
 thus womens immune systems are generally more responsive to infections
 this might mean women are able to tackle the novel coronavirus more effectively but this has not yet been proven
 thank you very much you have directed us a very important point regarding meta-regression
 we have run meta-regression to asses the effects of factors on the pooled prevalence and we found the following result
 univariate meta-regression analyses revealed that the prevalence of smoking was found to be high in males 
this contributed for high prevalence of covid-19 among males p0
002
 comorbidities like hypertension 0
042 diabetic mellitus 0
012 chronic respiratory disease 0
021 and cardio vascular disease 0
001 were also found to be higher in males and these significantly increases the prevalence of covid-19
 besides higher proportion of severcritical illness 0
003 and death 0
001 were also observed among males table 3 
 page 8 line 150-154 reviewer comment 9 they are also some inaccuracies in the text
 for instance page 4 line 58 the sentence reads so far 2019-ncov has affected more than 210 countries with 2 733591 confirmed cases




 there are 195 countries in the world today
 this total comprises 193 countries that are member states of the united nations and 2 countries that are non-member observer states the holy see and the state of palestine
 therefore the number of 210 countries cited by the authors is not correct

 governor of delhi has notified the delhi epidemic diseases covid-19 regulations 2020 in new delhi where all hospitals to have flu corners to test for suspect cases history of travelling to be recorded and right to impose home or institution are the important silent features
 on the other hand all the states of india applied the notification in which academic institutes will be closed until the next notification
 similarly the government and private companies have asked their employees to work from home due to novel pandemic issue
 the prime minister of india narendra modi announced a 21-day nationwide curfewlockdown to minimize the impact of novel coronavirus as he requested to indian citizens with folded hands to practise strict social distancing
to reduce the impact of novel coronavirus and its transmission lockdown activities launched in whole country with restriction of human mobility and economic activities
 however to observe comprehensive air quality data in different places of india it can be seen that these novel coronavirus disease countermeasures led to remarkable improvement in the concentration of air pollutants https aqicn 
orgmapindia 
 according to who 2018 4
2 million premature deaths were reported in the year of 2016 due to ambient air pollution
 so as per the air quality index is concerned the enhancement in air quality of india now would significantly avert premature deaths due to air pollution on monthlyannually basis
in india many studies indicated that the transportation and movement of respiratory diseases depend on seasonal variation humbal et al
 2018 humbal et al
  2019 humbal et al
  2020 
 in this regard we might expect that the effects of novel coronavirus will be decreased with higher temperature in summer due to reduction in intrinsic transmissibility of the novel virus gautam and trivedi 2020 jung et al
 2009 
 moreover ma et al
 2020 conducted the first study to identify the significant effects of meteorological parameters i
e
 temperature and relative humidity on daily mortality due to covid-19 in china
 this study clearly mentioned that the daily mortality of covid-19 is positively and negatively associated with temperature and relative humidity respectively
 it can be concluded that the warmer season higher temperature during next few months and lockdown activities will be key to reduce the exposure to novel coronavirus on humans
 close monitoring and real time data will be benefitted to predict and make sound public health decisions
 the world must prepare for the possibility that mitigation measures might fail because most of the countries are taking too much time to prevent or delay the spread of covid-19
 for example sars infects very small proportion of people around the world however many people will still become critically ill and need a better treatment or icu care
 the icu departments should be developed in advance with rapid diagnosis and isolation clinical management and infection prevention to control the incremental patients and optimize workflows
 to prepare for a substantial increase in critical care bed capacity three working bodies i
e
 state-national governments hospital authorities and decisionpolicy makers must come together and work with icu practitioners
 scientistsprofessorresearchers have to address the important questions-what remains a poorly understood disease
 the focus on high-quality research work real time data practices based on real evidences data availability based on open access ethical integration in the point of extraordinary challenges and collaboration with chain like local to national and national to international will be important key factors to the success of this hard work

9 per cent 176 sera belonged to the second trimester 30
8 per cent 97 sera to the third and 13
3 per cent 42 sera to the first
 viral antigens were propagated in primary or secondary fetal bovine testis cultures
 ma-104 bhk and hrt-18 cell lines were used for brv assays and preparation of fmdv and bcv antigens respectively
 the viral strains used were fmdv 01 campos bvdv oregon c-24 v bhv-i los angeles brv serotype 6 lincoln a bey strain obtained from s
 mcnulty veterinary research laboratories belfast and a field isolate of pi-3
antibodies against bvdv bhv-i fmdv and bcv were detected by indirect immunofluorescence m
 bovine rotavirus antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa and confirmed by 1if
 the authors found the iif more reliable since the positive samples had an elisa reading close to the cut-off value but were clearly positive by iif
 the haemagglutination inhibition 0ji method was employed for detection of anti-pi-3 antibodies
 to rule out the presence of non-specific haemagglutination inhibitors the positive samples were treated with neuraminidase and the hi assay was repeated
 blv antibodies were investigated by radial immunodiffusion
 antigen and positive control serum for this assay were kindly provided by the school of veterinary medicine university of la plata buenos aires
the results are shown in table 1 
 twenty-four sera were positive for antibodies against bvdv bhv-1 brv bcv or pi-3
 one of the samples had antibodies against both bhv-1 and bvdv
 no positives for fmdv or blv antibodies were detected
 non-specific inhibitors of the haemagglutination were also detected
 as expected positive samples were from fetuses in the second and third trimester which are fully able to synthesise immnnoglobulins schultz 1973 
 the prevalence of bvdv antibodies was 2-03 per cent four of 197 this is equivalent to the prevalence found in the usa in 1973 when a study involving 147 fetuses showed three to be seropositives hubbert et al 1973 
 however a recent report described that 13
9 per cent of 1608 pools of fetal sera from that country had bvdv antibodies
 each pool included sera from two to three fetuses and the percentage of seropositive fetuses would therefore be at least 4
6 per cent bolin et al 1991 
 the different values may reflect a current greater activity of the virus in the field or be a result of the application of modified live vaccines against bvdv
 in argentina vaccination is limited and carried out only with inactivated virus and fetal antibodies are elicited by a natural infection with wild type strains
antibodies against bhv-1 the agent of infectious bovine rhinotracheitisinfectious pustular vulvovaginitis were detected in 1
21 per cent of the samples two of 165
 a high percentage of cattle in argentina is infected with bhv-1 and viral isolations are common in diagnostic laboratories rodriguez et al 1989  therefore fetal antibodies are not unexpected
 the fetuses were seven and eight months old one of them also had bvdv antibodies table 1 
 using an inactivated virus kendrick and osburn 1973 showed that fetuses 100 days old are able to develop bhv-1 antibodies
 however the lethality of virulent strains of bhv-1 for fetuses younger than six months prevents the development of antibodies  wyler et al 1989 
the present results allow for an estimation of the probability of reproductive losses caused by bvdv and bhv-1 which are highly abortigenic kendrick 1971  wyler et al 1989 
 in addition bvdv may establish persistent infections in the fetus during the first 120 days of gestation brownlie 1990 
 assuming that the rate of fetal infection with either virus during the first trimester of pregnancy equals that of the second and third trimesters given by the prevalence of antibodies table  1  the chances of abortion due to bhv-i would be at least 1 per cent and the chances of abortion or births of calves persistently infected with bviv would be around 2 per cent
reported figures analysing bhv-1 and bvdv as causes of bovine abortions differ 2-9 per cent and 0
5 per cent of more than 3800 bovine abortions were caused by bhv-1 and bvdv respectively in the usa hubbert et al 1973  in britain lucas et al 1986 detected bvdv in 2
4 per cent of the 330 aborted fetuses analysed with 4 per cent of bvdv antibodies in fetal fluids and no bhv-1 antibodies or antigen
 in australia bvdv was detected in 2 per cent of 265 aborted fetuses jerrett et al 1984 
 in argentina abortions attributable to both agents occur  campero et al 1991  but no studies of a large number of cases have been made
 since the present samples were taken at random and originated in different herds from different regions the gross estimation of fetal losses induced by bhv-t or bvdv might be quite accurate
the authors can also estimate the probability of births of calves with central nervous system lesions induced by bvdv because infected fetuses 90 to 150 days old are prone to develop such lesions roeder et al 1986 
 the prevalence of bvdv antibodies in two fetuses four months old two of 197 table 1 indicates that roughly 1 per cent of the calves may be born with these lesions
five of 205 fetuses 2
44 per cent were positive for brv antibodies and five of 110 4
54 per cent were positive for bcv antibodies
 these are enteric viruses for which no viraemia has been described for this reason the finding of antibodies was unexpected
 however there is at least one report describing the detection of antibodies against these agents in fetal and precolostral serum samples in japan using the hi and neutralisation tests sato et al 1980 
 for brv antibodies the present authors employed an elisa and the iif test for confirmation
 as it was possible that the sera contained some non-specific factors able to bind to bay antigens denatured by the fixation procedures in these assays a seroneutralisation test against 1000 tcid50 of bovine rotavirus serotype 6 was conducted not shown
 partial neutralisation occurred demonstrating binding of the sera to the native proteins in the virion
 the possibility exists and should be investigated of the antibodies being against a different serotype of rotavirus as shown by briissow et al 1991  or that sera contain non-anti-body factors which partially neutralise the virus tokuhisa et al 1981 
for the detection of the brv and bcv antibody the percentage of seropositives found was considerably lower than that detected in japan
 tokuhisa et al 1981 detected non-specific virus-binding factors able to neutralise these viruses
 the differences in prevalence observed may be due to an authentic lesser proportion of infected fetuses to the absence of those factors in the samples used or to a greater specificity of the iif assay employed
pi-3 antibodies were detected in nine of 177 samples 5
08 per cent
 although most authors were not able to detect anti-pi-3 antibodies in fetal sera homer et al 1973  hubbert et al 1973  this was the highest prevalence in the present survey
 by treatment of the samples with neuraminidase the authors detected non-specific inhibitors of haemagglutination in 14
68 per cent of the samples as did homer et al 1973 
 the inhibitors were found exclusively in the oldest sera and the authors assume that they were derived from the denaturing of sera during storage
 although in argentina most of the adult bovine population are seropositive against pi-3 and the dams are usually immune not allowing the virus to reach the fetus the detected seroprevalence is comparatively high
 the fetopathic properties of pi-3 under field conditions are not clear but the virus can be recovered from aborted fetuses lucas et al 1986 and hi antibodies have been detected in fetal fluids and sera from aborted fetuses schultz 1973  jerrett et al 1984 
 no conclusive data are available and whether fetuses infected with pi-3 especially during the first trimester will be aborted remains an open question
the present authors did not detect fmdv or blv antibodies
 since fmdv is endemic in most of argentina the negative results in the search for fmdv antibodies and fmdv isolation attempts in fetal organs not shown supported the hypothesis that the virus was unable to pass the placental barrier schudel and sadir 1986 
in argentina blv antibodies can be detected both in adult cattle and in precolostral sera by the immunodiffusion assay employed
 the negative results can be explained by the low number of samples studied
 the percentage of seropositive samples in infected herds is relatively low 3 to 6 per cet of the infected dams toma et al 1990 and it is probable that the analysis of a greater number of sera would give some positive results
since only fetuses older than four months are able to produce an antibody response and some viral agents induce abortions viral infections of fetuses in the first trimester of gestation are easily missed unless viral isolations are attempted
 the analysis of the seroprevalence is only a first approach to the study of fetal infections but the results emphasise the need for prophylactic measures and routine controls of diagnostic and pharmaceutical reagents derived from fetal bovine tissues

abstract
death certification requires the same effort and dedication as all reports by doctors during their patients lifetimes
 the physician must follow the basic instructions to complete a death certificate correctly taking special care to fill in the sequence of causes of death
 in the case of a pandemic completion of the death certificate falls to the primary care physician and therefore the official bodies must publish instructions based on international recommendations
 it should be established as soon as possible whether it is possible to report deaths telematically
 while this is not possible in a pandemic procedures should be put in place to enable the immediate reporting of deaths to the health authorities
keywords death certificate pandemic mortality covid-19el conocimiento documentado de la propia historia social y de los individuos que la conforman es característico de las culturas desarrolladas
 uno de los factores que influyen en ese conocimiento social es la existencia de registros
 los registros de nacimiento y de defunción son buenos instrumentos para conocer nuestra historia social
 en españa encontramos documentos de registros de este tipo que datan del siglo xvi preservados en las parroquias junto con las partidas de bautismo
 con el tiempo la inscripción se hizo también al margen de las iglesias
 fue el estado de massachusetts el primer lugar en mantener registros de defunción en los tribunales de justicia 1639 1
 la certificación médica de defunción apareció en el último tercio del siglo xix por varios motivos
por un lado la mayor proximidad asistencial del médico al moribundo en el ámbito urbano junto con la fundamentación científica de la higiene pública que en gran parte se apoyó en el desarrollo de la estadística sanitaria y de la prevención pública
 esto también dio lugar a nuevas legislaciones y códigos civiles y al origen de los registros civiles
 además la incorporación de la estadística sanitaria llevó a la internacionalización de la prevención de la enfermedad
 a fines del siglo xix casi todos los países europeos tenían sistemas centralizados de registros de mortalidad
en 1871 tras varios intentos se logró la puesta en marcha del registro civil rc en españa 2 
este avance vino precedido por un periodo de transición que supuso la implantación de un j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f registro parcial provincial para grandes y medianas poblaciones en el año 1841
 la ley exigía a todos los municipios la creación de un rc en el que se debían inscribir los datos referentes al estado civil de todos los españoles nacimientos matrimonios defunciones etc
 al margen de sus creencias
 un siglo más tarde en 1957 se constató la necesidad de actualizar y renovar la ley entonces vigente adaptándola a las necesidades de la época dando lugar a la ley de 8 de según el reglamento que desarrolla la ley del rc debe cumplimentar el cmd-bed el facultativo que haya asistido al difunto en su última enfermedad o cualquier otro que reconozca el cadáver 7
 el código de deontología médica cd 8 regula el compromiso de certificar la muerte señalando que aunque el médico que haya tenido la mayor carga asistencial sobre el paciente es el que tiene la mayor responsabilidad ética de cumplimentar el certificado de defunción en todos sus apartados no es deontológicamente aceptable rehuir el compromiso de certificarla cuando se produce si se ha presenciado la misma se conoce al paciente o se tiene a disposición la historia clínica
 en el reverso del primer impreso del cmd-bed encontramos unas instrucciones básicas de certificación figura 1 que establece la oms para seguir a la hora de cumplimentar el certificado
 cuando se trata de muertes violentas o sospechosas de criminalidad no procede la firma del cmd-bed derivándose estas muertes a investigación judicial 9 
 el procedimiento general de manejo y notificación de los fallecimientos se recoge en la figura 2
el cmd-bed es un documento médico-legal en el que el profesional debe poner el mismo esfuerzo y dedicación que en el resto de los informes elaborados en vida del paciente
 clínica y éticamente se puede firmar un certificado con criterios de presunción si el desenlace es posible y hay compatibilidad entre la información sobre las circunstancias del fallecimiento y su patobiografía no siendo aceptable en cambio no firmarlo escudándose en un posible delito de falsedad que recoge el código penal
 en nuestra experiencia y la de otros autores se confirma que difícilmente se perseguirá a un médico que de buena fe y previa exploración del paciente certifique como natural una muerte que no lo sea 10 siendo un deber ético la cumplimentación del cmd-bed
 en esta situación se prioriza el ahorro de sufrimiento a los familiares por delante de las dudas legales no razonables humanizando el trato en unas circunstancias de padecimiento emocional tan intensas 11 
desde su publicación en 2009 el cmd-bed ha sufrido alguna modificación
 en la primera versión del cmd-bed las hoy llamadas causas intermedias se denominaban también causas antecedentes
 tras menos de dos años el ine comprobó que se estaba cumplimentando equivocadamente dicha variable y elaboró un documento que hizo llegar a los médicos a través de los cm 12
 en él se recogía que muchos médicos han interpretado este campo como antecedentes clínicos y no como debería entenderse es decir anotar en las llamadas causas antecedentes aquellos procesos que siendo debidos a la causa inicial produjeron la causa inmediata de muerte
 recientemente se han modificado incorporando código qr y recogiendo el número de colegiación de nueve cifras estableciendo las casillas de forma independiente para su adecuada cumplimentación
la correcta cumplimentación del cmd-bed tiene importantes consecuencias desde el punto de vista de política sanitaria
 en base a ellos el ine extrae de estos documentos las causas de defunción con los que genera las estadísticas oficiales de mortalidad
 según los resultados obtenidos se toman medidas de prevención y se destinarán los recursos necesarios para afrontar las necesidades existentes mediante la implementación de políticas sanitarias
 no cumplimentar adecuadamente las causas de muerte figura 3 puede tener una gran importancia desde el punto de vista epidemiológico 13 derivando como consecuencia de esto en una mala organización de los recursos destinados a la salud tanto en la investigación de enfermedades como en la implantación de políticas preventivas
j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f existe poca experiencia en nuestro medio en relación a la certificación de fallecimientos durante las epidemias
 se entiende que si se producen múltiples fallecimientos los procedimientos de actuación podrían ser semejantes a los de situaciones de catástrofe
 como sostienen barbería et al 14 las catástrofes constituyen un problema de salud pública al ser susceptibles de incrementar la morbilidad y mortalidad y disminuir la calidad de vida
 las epidemias cumplen evidentemente estas condiciones
 el papel de la certificación de las causas de la muerte en el caso de grandes catástrofes corresponde a la medicina forense 15 y el de la certificación en epidemias corresponde a la medicina asistencial 16 pero la comparación puede ser útil en el establecimiento de procedimientos para el manejo de cadáveres y la certificación de la muerte en casos de múltiples fallecimientos en epidemias 17 
quizá el único ejemplo que tenemos en españa de epidemias con múltiples fallecimientos y con registros de los mismos es la pandemia de gripe de 1918
 su estallido generó múltiples estudios científicos análisis estadísticos y una fuerte reacción de la prensa a partir de mayo de 1918
 fue una experiencia terrible para la sociedad que generó múltiples medidas para combatirla por parte de los gobiernos y respuestas extraordinarias por parte de los profesionales de la salud y de la población en general
 los estudios sobre la pandemia de gripe de 1918 han comprendido no sólo el análisis de los datos de morbi-mortalidad que son muy importantes en si mismos sino que también ha llevado a una comprensión de la epidemia más allá de las cifras
para poder evaluar las repercusiones que la epidemia tuvo sobre la mortalidad contamos con la información contenida en los movimientos naturales de población elaborados por el ine y con los boletines mensuales de demografía sanitaria que confeccionaba el ministerio de la gobernación
 estos datos sin embargo son insuficientes para descender a detalles
 por ejemplo los relacionados con los distritos de las ciudades
 porras 18 ha estudiado la estadística demográfica que confeccionaba anualmente el servicio de estadística del ayuntamiento de madrid así como los resúmenes generales anuales de esas estadísticas demográficas
 el cruce de esos datos con los fondos del rc y los libros de defunción correspondientes a los años 1918 y 1919 ha permitido determinar con detalle la evolución de la morbi-mortalidad de la pandemia en españa 19 
sin embargo ayer como hoy las cifras de mortalidad cambiaban según los criterios que se aplicaban así por ejemplo en el caso de madrid las tasas brutas de mortalidad general y específica de 1918 y 1919 que se obtenían a partir de los datos del rc y de los resúmenes generales anuales de las estadísticas demográficas del ayuntamiento de madrid eran muy diferentes ya que civilmente las muertes se consignaron en el distrito correspondiente a su j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f lugar de fallecimiento mientras que el ayuntamiento elaboró sus estadísticas a partir de los datos de los cementerios donde las muertes se anotaban en el distrito en el que se residía y no en el que se moría
 es un ejemplo de la complejidad de los estudios de morbimortalidad históricos 18 20 recomendaciones nacionales e internacionales sobre la certificación médica de la defunción en relación al covid-19
el 29 de marzo de 2020 el cgcom emitió un comunicado en el que de acuerdo con las definiciones propuestas por la oms la vocalía nacional de administraciones públicas informaba acerca del procedimiento a seguir en la certificación de las defunciones durante la actual epidemia de covid-19 16 
 el documento señala que las muertes producidas en una epidemia son muertes naturales
 no hace falta comunicar al ámbito médico-legal o judicial el fallecimiento
 la intervención judicial del médico forense se limitará a los casos de muerte violenta o en los que exista clara sospecha de criminalidad
 en esos casos en los que la investigación de la muerte corresponde al ámbito medico-legal el hecho de presentar una pcr sars-cov-2 positiva indica un dato de interés epidemiológico que quizá deba tenerse en cuenta como factor agravante si la muerte se produce de forma diferida al hecho traumático pero esa posible concausa corresponde analizarla al profesional forense
 en el resto de los casos la certificación de la muerte corresponde a los médicos asistenciales con independencia de que trabajen en un ámbito público o privado en la misma línea de lo recogido en otros países de nuestro entorno 21 22 
 si previamente señalábamos que ante el fallecimiento de una persona se debe priorizar el ahorro de sufrimiento a los familiares por delante de las dudas legales no razonables a la hora de la certificación humanizando el trato en unas circunstancias de padecimiento emocional tan intensas 11  en circunstancias como las vividas en esta pandemia este principio se hace mas necesario que nunca
el documento del cgcom establecía dos escenarios a la hora de certificar muertes covid-19
 el primero se refería a aquellos en los que no existe confirmación analítica pero hay clínica compatible con la enfermedad
 en estas circunstancias se recomendaba certificar como covid-19 no confirmado o sospecha de infección por coronavirus como causa fundamental
 y como causa inmediata se proponía usar fallo multiorgánico distrés respiratorio o insuficiencia respiratoria aguda señalando que podrán reflejarse causas intermedias si las hubiera o se conocieran como neumonía sepsis o coagulopatía
 el segundo escenario es aquel en el que los casos de covid 19 se han confirmado mediante test de laboratorio
 en esos casos la causa fundamental deberá ser covid-19 confirmado
para cualquiera de los escenarios anteriores un tema importante es cómo se registra la comorbilidad de los pacientes fallecidos por covid-19 23 24 
 el documento de la omc señala que en el apartado otros procesos deberán recogerse las patologías o comorbilidades que conllevan un mayor riesgo de desarrollar enfermedad grave si existieran enfermedades cardiovasculares hipertensión arterial o diabetes
en ocasiones se planea la disyuntiva de morir por covid-19 o morir con covid-19 pudiendo resultar complejo determinar si es la enfermedad covid-19 la causante del proceso de la muerte o lo es una patología previa
 aquí sólo cabe la reflexión del facultativo que firma el certificado a la vista de los datos de la evolución clínica del paciente fallecido lo que puede requerir un estudio profundo de su historial médico
 en todo caso el contenido de los cmd-bed es valorado con posterioridad por los profesionales de los registros de mortalidad permitiendo modificaciones de la causa fundamental tras el estudio de la historia clínica y la comunicación en su caso con el profesional que en su momento hubiera certificado el fallecimiento
el documento del cgcom se basaba en la guía internacional de la oms para la certificación del covid-19 que posteriormente se ha modificado en una publicación del 16 de abril de 2020 que recoge ejemplos para la certificación de muertes no covid-19 25
en cuanto a la codificación de las muertes la oms establece el código u07
1 para los fallecimientos por covid-19 confirmados mediante estudio analítico y u07
2 para los fallecimientos sin test confirmatorios en los que el diagnostico se basa en criterios clínicos yo epidemiológicos de covid-19 probable o sospechoso 26 
a los efectos de toma de decisiones define y diferencia casos sospechosos o probables este documento define en los que sobreviven a la enfermedad como caso probable mientras no exista comunicación telemática puede ser útil establecer procedimientos excepcionales como el que se ha establecido en castilla la mancha 33 
 otras propuestas como la participación de los institutos de medicina legal y ciencias forenses imlcf en sistemas específicos de vigilancia de la mortalidad permitiría conocer en tiempo real los fallecimientos y sus causas en circunstancias tan excepcionales como las vividas
 esta participación se sustenta en la supervisión de los cmd-bed que realizan los médicos forenses en funciones de médicos del rc en algunos imlcf en españa
 este cpmetido generalmente circunscrito a los grandes municipios podría ampliarse al control de los cmd-bed recibidos en todas las oficinas de rc de esa comunidad
 así los imlcf trasladarían diariamente la información de los cmd-bed a los servicios de salud pública de cada comunidad
 esta participación que se ha llevado a cabo de manera exitosa en castilla y león aportaría un gran valor añadido a los circuitos de notificación habituales
desde el punto de vista práctico debemos poder contar con suficientes certificados de defunción certificados a los que se tiene acceso en los com provinciales
 ante una situación de pandemia y especialmente con medidas de confinamiento se deben prever mecanismos de remisión rápidos y sencillos entre los com y los servicios funerarios yo asistenciales
como conclusión señalamos que la cumplimentación del cmd-bed es un acto médico trascendente que requiere una valoración integral de la patobiografía del paciente y que ayuda a humanizar el trato a las familias en circunstancias de padecimiento emocional intensas
 se debe mejorar los métodos de comunicación de la mortalidad estableciendo la posibilidad de certificación telemática
 en circunstancias de epidemias y pandemias es necesario que se emitan recomendaciones claras sobre la certificación por parte de organismos oficiales y establecer si no es posible la comunicación telemática circuitos más ágiles que permitan conocer la mortalidad en tiempo real
  
 protein profiles of golgi-enriched fractions isolated from s
 typhimurium-infected cells were compared with those of mock-infected cells revealing significant depletion or enrichment of 105 proteins
 sirna-mediated depletion of a selection of affected proteins identified five host factors involved in salmonella infection

 helms salmonella typhimurium a gram-negative bacterium is a serovar of the species salmonella enterica
 enterica serovars cause a variety of different diseases in man and other animals
 typhimurium infections are a major cause of foodborne illness in humans throughout the world
 typhimurium infection usually leads to a self-limiting gastroenteritis
 enterica serovar typhi 1 2 3 
 investigations into hostpathogen interactions by s
 typhimurium therefore increase not only our understanding of the pathogenesis of gastroenteritis but also that of typhoid fever
 typhimurium can infect both macrophages and epithelial cells
 once the epithelial barrier has been passed they can infect macrophages adjacent to the epithelial layer 4 5 
 the infection of epithelial cells is a crucial step in salmonella infection
 the bacterium invades this type of cells by inducing its own uptake
 for this purpose it employs a specialized secretion apparatus called a type three secretion system t3ss
 these effector proteins modify host cell functions to the benefit of the bacterium
 once inside the host cell the bacterium resides in a so-called salmonellacontaining vacuole scv
 drug-induced disruption of the golgi apparatus has been demonstrated to decrease salmonella replication 29 
 in addition to positioning itself in the golgi region during replication s
 typhimurium can also redirect host secretory traffic
 this results in the accumulation of exocytic cargo vesicles post-golgi vesicles in close proximity of the scv 31 
 thus during infection salmonella interacts with the host cell secretory pathway in several ways
 however the details of these interactions and the host proteins involved are largely unknown
 insight into the interplay between salmonella and the host is important for our understanding of salmonella infection
to investigate salmonella-host interactions in more detail we used a quantitative proteomics approach
 recently we applied this technique to investigate interactions of coronaviruses with the host secretory pathway 33 
 for the infection experiments wild-type s
 typhimurium strain 14028 obtained from atcc was used
 typhimurium cultures were grown in luria bertani broth lb biotrading for 16-18 h at 371c with continuous shaking
5 h to reach the exponential phase as described before 34 
for the 13 c 15 n-arginine-and 13 c 15 n-lysine-labeling of hela cells cells were cultured in specialized medium

 the heavy and light culture media were supplemented with dialyzed fcs invitrogen cat
 26400-044 and penstrep similarly as described above
 cells were passaged in fresh medium when 80-90 confluency was reached
 the extent and efficiency of the stable isotope labeling of the hela cells were checked using maldi-tof-tof analysis
the silac procedure which was described by ong et al
 32  was performed with certain adjustments as we published previously 33 
 cells from eight culture flasks were used per experiment four flasks per labeling condition
 typhimurium at an moi of 100 or mock-infected for six hours as described above
 the salmonella-infected cells were harvested in homogenization buffer 250 mm sucrose in 10 mm tris-hcl ph7

 a golgi-enriched fraction was isolated from the cells using an established method 33 35 36 37 
 cells were homogenized with the balch homogenizer gap size 9 mm
 post-nuclear supernatant pns was obtained after centrifugation of the cell homogenate at 1700 rpm for 10 min at 41c
 this pns was mixed with 62 ww sucrose in 10 mm tris ph 7

 subsequently mascot generic files were generated through in-house developed software
 these files were used to search the ipihuman 3
 peptide modifications used in the searches were carbamidomethyl on cysteine fixed and oxidation on methionine tryptophan and histidine variable
 all quantified peptides were checked by manual inspection of the spectra used for quantification
 to identify statistically different protein abundances between samples po0
05 data from three independent experiments were loaded into the statquant program for statistical analysis 43 
two sirna oligos per gene targeting two different sites within the coding region were obtained from ambion
 for each gene both oligos showed the same effect on salmonella replication reflecting the specificity of the validated oligos
 scrambled sirnas ambion and mock-transfected cells only oligofectamine were used as controls in each experiment
 forty-eight hours after sirna transfection the cells were infected with s
 typhimurium at an moi of 100 as described above
1 sds for 2 min and a dilution series was plated onto lb agar as described 44 
 the salmonella fold increase was determined by dividing the number of colony forming units cfu at 8 h p
 by the number of cfu at 1 hour p
 each sirna experiment was performed in triplicate
to validate the knockdown of the targeted genes in the sirna experiments mrna levels of each gene were determined

 typhimurium or mock-infected by applying a quantitative proteomics approach based on silac
 since salmonella replication is strongly dependent on its golgi localization 29  which occurs 4-8 h p
 we allowed infection to proceed for 6 h before golgi isolation
proteins from the isolated golgi fractions were separated by sds-page digested using in-gel tryptic digestion and subjected to lc-msms
 figure 1 shows the ratio distribution of the 765 identified proteins
 the statquant program 43 was used to calculate for which proteins the ratios differed significantly po0
org and the panther classification system protein analysis through evolutionary relationships httpwww
 the overall distribution of the 105 affected proteins was only slightly different from that of the 765 identified proteins
 the distribution of the affected proteins is somewhat changed for the cytoskeletal cyt- golgi apparatus- mitochondrial-and endosomal-localized proteins

 the largest group of proteins consisted of proteins annotated to be localized to the cytoplasm
 this group contained an equal proportion of enriched and depleted proteins
 the identified proteins were also categorized according to their molecular function annotation fig
by performing rna interference experiments we validated the functional relevance of affected proteins in the salmonella infection cycle
 from the 105 affected proteins 21 proteins were selected  table 2

the approach to patient routing has changed significantly
 if one is not diagnosed with covid-19 ct scan and laboratory testing are provided immediately
 the patients should be admitted to the surgical department where treatment is provided only to those covid-19 negative
 those treated in infectious diseases hospital or covid-19 dedicated centre are managed by the surgical team present
surgery has become highly elective being mostly available for high-risk patients with emergencies malignancies cardiovascular pathologies or infections

surgery for benign disorders precancerous lesions and reconstructive procedures are currently postponed
 regarding colorectal cancer surgical treatment may be postponed if it is a non-obstructing disease 7 
laparoscopic surgery and diathermy are limited as well

0000028b5cc154f68b8a269f6578f21e31f62977   according to current live statistics at the time of editing this letter russia has been the third country in the world to be affected by covid-19 with both new cases and death rates rising
 it remains in a position of advantage due to the later onset of the viral spread within the country since the worldwide disease outbreak
the first step in fighting the epidemic was nationwide lock down on march 30 th  2020
most of the multidisciplinary hospitals have been repurposed as dedicated covid-19 centres so the surgeons started working as infectious disease specialists
 such a reallocation of health care capacity results in the effective management of this epidemiological problem 1 
 the staff has undergone on-line 36-hour training course to become qualified in coronavirus infection treatment
the surgeons of covid-19 dedicated hospitals do rarely practice surgery
 when icu patients need mechanical ventilation percutaneous tracheostomy under endoscopic control is mostly performed as it decreases the aerosol formation viral load on staff and complications associated with an endotracheal tube in comparison with surgical tracheostomy 2 
 however it is still associated with the risk of aerosol formation so different approaches should be considered for a long-time perspective 3 
the majority of the studies dedicated to colorectal diseases are temporarily paused
 the teaching and training are mostly translated via online platforms which has excluded the opportunity to get clinical experience in surgery 4 
the approach to patient routing has changed significantly
 if one is not diagnosed with covid-19 ct scan and laboratory testing are provided immediately
 the patients should be admitted to the surgical department where treatment is provided only to those covid-19 negative
the patient isolated for more than 2 weeks and covid-19 negative as a result of 2 subsequent tests is admitted to the surgical department with an option to readmission to the infectious department and can be treated by surgical staff which does not work with covid-19 positive patients
the patient diagnosed with coronavirus infection and treated at home is admitted to covid-19 dedicated multidisciplinary hospital where surgical care is provided
 those treated in infectious diseases hospital or covid-19 dedicated centre are managed by the surgical team present
surgery has become highly elective being mostly available for high-risk patients with emergencies malignancies cardiovascular pathologies or infections
 preoperative testing in surgical patients with respiratory symptoms and history of travelling or contacting with covid-19 positive people and postoperative recovery in the operating unit seem to be highly effective measures 5 
 a lot of rearrangements are performed locally regarding personal protective equipment the organization of scrubbing donning and doffing and dedicated changing areas
 moreover observational departments are organized in surgical hospitals for patient allocation before coronavirus infection status is defined 6 
surgery for benign disorders precancerous lesions and reconstructive procedures are currently postponed
 regarding colorectal cancer surgical treatment may be postponed if it is a non-obstructing disease 7 
laparoscopic surgery and diathermy are limited as well
 the importance of special operating theatre for covid-19 patients with negative pressure ventilation unidirectional laminar flow as well as the use of smoke evacuation systems during surgery are taken into account 8 
such an electiveness of surgery is concerning as it might cause a worldwide healthcare catastrophe in the post-pandemic era 5 
 more efforts should be taken to expand the amount and types of surgical procedures performed
due to the early preventive and corrective actions we have already reached the plateau in new cases curve counting for up to 8 984 cases identified at the time of writing this paper june 7 th  2020 with a mortality rate of 1⋅5075
 these statistical outcomes are resulted by a 68-day lockdown admission regime and healthcare rearrangement

 it is not known which mechanism lies behind the absence of surface expressed viral antigens
 this observation is consistent with the in vitro findings of dewerchin et al
 they showed that 50 of fipv 79-1146 infected monocytes do not express viral antigens on the plasma membrane
 another possibility is antibody-induced capping of viral antigens and extrusion from the cell
besides antibody-mediated elimination of virusinfected cells cytotoxic t lymphocytes ctls are also capable of killing infected cells
 during an infection viral peptides are loaded on mhc i molecules and transported to the plasma membrane
 this complex may be recognized by ctls which leads to killing of the infected cell
 in this study the presence of mhc i on fipv positive cells was analyzed
with the exception of two cats higher cell death in infected cells seems to be present in pyogranulomas
 in exudates this observation was not made
 the cause of this difference between pyogranulomas and exudates is not clear
 since no viral antigens are present on the plasma membrane it can be stated that antibody-mediated lysis is inhibited
 the precise role of the cellular immune response in protection needs to be further investigated

 1 of mhc i expression was observed between live and dead cells

 this staining showed that the percentage of dead fipv positive monocytes in pyogranulomas was significantly higher than the control cells fipv negative dh95b positive cells  p  0
1 whereas no difference was observed in exudates between fipv positive monocytes and the control cells
in this study it was shown that fipv positive monocytes in cats with fip express mhc i on their surface but not viral antigens
the presence of viral antigens on the cell surface of infected cells is important for the recognition and elimination of infected cells by the immune system
 binding of virus-specific antibodies to viral proteins present on the surface makes infected cells recognizable for the classical complement pathway phagocytes and natural killer cells which will lead to lysis of infected cells harper 1994 
 in this study viral antigens were not detected on the surface of fipv positive cells isolated from nine cats with fip
 this could implicate that the fipv positive cells may remain invisible for the humoral immune system and continue the production of progeny virus without being eliminated
 it is not known which mechanism lies behind the absence of surface expressed viral antigens
 the results of the cultivation experiment demonstrated that about half of the infected cells are not capable of expressing viral antigens on their surface
 this observation is consistent with the in vitro findings of dewerchin et al
 2005 
 they showed that 50 of fipv 79-1146 infected monocytes do not express viral antigens on the plasma membrane
the absence of viral antigens on the surface of fipv positive cells isolated from fip cats that seem to be capable of expressing viral antigens can be due to the fact that virus-specific antibodies bind to the antigens and as a consequence the viral antigens are internalized
 another possibility is antibody-induced capping of viral antigens and extrusion from the cell
 since the antibody-induced internalization has been described in in vitro infected monocytes that do show surface expressed viral antigens it most likely occurs also in vivo dewerchin et al
 2006 
the fact that viral antigens could not be demonstrated with the used staining is not the result of antibodies present in the cat that already bound to these antigens and hinder binding of other antibodies
 this hindering is not likely to occur since in fipvinfected crandell feline kidney cells surface expressed fipv antigens covered by strain specific antibodies were still accessible for other antibodies data not shown
besides antibody-mediated elimination of virusinfected cells cytotoxic t lymphocytes ctls are also capable of killing infected cells
 during an infection viral peptides are loaded on mhc i molecules and transported to the plasma membrane
 this complex may be recognized by ctls which leads to killing of the infected cell
 in this study the presence of mhc i on fipv positive cells was analyzed
 on all fipv positive cells mhc i was present showing that no internalization or retention of the mhc i molecules occurs
 however with the used techniques it was not possible to quantify the number of mhc i molecules and to determine whether the mhc i molecules were loaded with fipv peptides
with the exception of two cats higher cell death in infected cells seems to be present in pyogranulomas
 in exudates this observation was not made
 the cause of this difference between pyogranulomas and exudates is not clear
 the increased cell death may be due to infection or to the response of the immune system on the infected cell
 since no viral antigens are present on the plasma membrane it can be stated that antibody-mediated lysis is inhibited
 the expression of mhc i is not inhibited in infected cells indicating that the cellular immunity may still be able to lyse the infected cell if viral peptides are presented
 it is generally accepted that a strong cellular immunity enables the cat to overcome infection pedersen and black 1983 hayashi et al
 1982 weiss and cox 1989 
 however it has also been postulated that during a chronic fipv infection the cell-mediated lysis is inhibited due to apoptosis and t-cell depletion caused by soluble mediators released during infection haagmans et al
 1996 de groot-mijnes et al
 2005 
 taking into account all these observations it becomes clear that the outcome of a fipv infection is a complicated interaction of the immune system and the virus
 one thing is sure the humoral immune response is not able to protect the cat against progression of viral replication and consequently of disease
 the precise role of the cellular immune response in protection needs to be further investigated
in conclusion it can be stated that cytoplasmic fipv-infected cells do not show surface expressed viral antigens in vivo which may make them invisible for the humoral immune response
 in contrast mhc i molecules are abundantly present on their surface

 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded ribonucleic acid rna virus and has been identified as the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 disease 1 
 to avoid uncontrolled viral spread high-throughput testing and subsequent isolation of infected individuals was advised 2 
 however due to limited laboratory testing capacities only symptomatic individuals could be tested in the beginning of the 2020 pandemic 3 
 on the other hand it has been shown that a large proportion of individuals remain asymptomatic
 therefore a clinical definition of covid-19 is not reliable and laboratory confirmation of sars-cov-2 is currently advised for confirmation 4 
 as asymptomatic patients tested positive for sars-cov-2 the lack of test capacity resulted in a lack of knowledge of the underlying true infection risk 5 6 
 since then test capacities have been upscaled but there is still an urgent need for reliable and cost-effective high-throughput testing methods specifically as regulations are currently easing and loci of rapid spread need to be detected as early as possible to avoid uncontrolled viral spread
mass spectrometric ms techniques have largely complemented or replaced traditional methods in laboratory medicine toxicology microbiology as well as molecular pathology and are suitable for reliable cost-effective and rapid detection of amplified polymerase chain reaction pcr products 7 8 9 10 11 
 thus this method has a great potential to complement the current diagnostic arsenal especially in times where a shortage of reagents may limit the application of real-time reverse transcriptase rrt-pcr which is the current gold standard for the detection of sars-cov-2 12 
therefore we established and tested a ms-based test protocol for its ability to detect sars-cov-2 from oral or nasopharyngeal swabs and compared the results to rrt-pcr
oral or nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from patients and transferred to the laboratory in viral transport medium
 rna isolation and rrt-pcr for sars-cov-2 detection were conducted at the same day institute for immunology and genetics kaiserslautern
 a total of 22 samples that tested positive and 22 samples that tested negative were selected and tested with a sars-cov-2 ms assay in two independent laboratories institute for immunology and genetics kaiserslautern and institute for molecular pathology trier within two weeks after rrt-pcr
 samples were obtained from corona screening centers from two local hospitals in the period from march 14 2020 to april 24 2020
 ms and rrt-pcr results were compared
 informed written consent has been obtained from all the patients
rna from clinical samples was isolated with the chemagic viral dnarna 300 kit special h96 cat cmg-1033-s perkinelmer waltham ma usa in 96-sample batches with 300 µl sample input on the chemagic magnetic separation module i instrument perkinelmer in approximately 60 min
 eluted rna was used for subsequent analysis or stored at −80
amplification of viral rna by rrt-pcr was performed with the commercially available ce-certified virellasars-cov-2 seqc rrt-pcr kit including primers and dual-labeled probes ref g01128-32 gerbion kornwestheim germany using 6 µl rna input in a total rt-pcr mix of 20 µl on a abi 7500 instrument applied biosystem waltham ma usa according to the manufacturers protocols

 all assay components exhibit 100 sequence homology to conserved sars-cov-2 regions except for the forward pcr primer for the sc2n2 assay
 according to the sequence data as of may 20 2020 8 of the sars-cov-2 sequences have a three-nucleotide mismatch with the first three 5 end nucleotides of the sc2n2 forward pcr primer 22 nucleotide length
 this results in the 86 pcr primer homology for the 8 of sars-cov-2 population and the 98

for 43 of 44 patient samples basic clinical data were available
 30 70 patients were male and 13 30 female
 mean age was 43 min-max 7-77
all samples included in the study n  44 were successfully analyzed by rrt-pcr and the ms test system
 none of the 44 samples failed quality control
 positive and negative test results were concordant in all samples
 a representative example of a positive and a negative result of both tests is shown in figures 1 and 2

 hands-on-time of the rrt-pcr and the ms test were 40 min for both  table 2 
 viruses 2020 12 x for peer review 4 of 9 a total of six coronaviruses are known to cause human disease from which two strains sars-cov-2 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus are thought to be zoonotic and have been associated with more severe potentially fatal outcomes 14 
sars-cov-2 is an enveloped single-stranded positive-sense rna virus and belongs to the genus of beta-coronaviruses is spherical in shape about 60-140 nm in diameter and has 9-12 nm long characteristic spikes on the surface 15 
 this virus has been identified as the causative agent of covid-19 disease after the world health organization country office was informed about cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology in wuhan city hubei province in china on 31 december 2019 12 
 to detect infection with sars-cov-2 saliva sputum oral or nasopharyngeal swabs stool anal swabs blood or urine can be analyzed and highest rates of detection have been reported for sputum oral or nasopharyngeal swabs 16 
 however the peak diagnostic yield might depend on the time of onset of symptoms 17 
 in this study we tested material derived from oral and nasopharyngeal swabs
the genome of a typical cov contains a 5 untranslated region utr a conserved replicase domain orf1ab including the rdrp gene four genes s e m and n to encode structural proteins spike envelope membrane and nucleocapsid proteins a 3 utr and several unidentified non-structural orfs which are potential targets for their detection 18 
 these gene regions may be used to identify infection with sars-cov-2
interestingly recommendations regarding which gene regions should be targeted to identify the virus are highly variable
 for example in the us three genes targeting the n-gene are recommended for emergency testing in germany the charité recommends the identification of the e gene for screening and identification of the rdrp gene for confirmation 12 
 the latter recommendation is based on the fact that the region of the e gene is commonly shared between sars-cov-2 and other bat or human related sars viruses and the rdrp sequence is specific for sars-cov-2 12 
 generally two to three targets need to be detected to qualify as a reliable result 18 
 moreover an internal quality control is currently recommended which is also in the ms detection kit 18 
the analysis of rrt-pcr may be affected by false-negative and false-positive results
 in this regard it has been shown that multiple testing in the course of disease can improve the rate of viral detection 4 16 19 20 21 
 one study found that in 21
4 of patients a positive detection of sars-cov-2 could only be achieved after two consecutive negative results 21 
 interestingly 16
7 of patients with typical features of covid-19 pneumonia on a computer tomography scan were negative by rrt-pcr half of these patients became positive after the second test and half of the remaining patients became positive after the third test 4 
 it was found that the rrt-pcr results from several tests at different time points were variable from the same patients during the course of diagnosis and treatment 19 
 this might explain the fact that only about 50 of clinically confirmed cases are confirmed by a positive rrt-pcr result
 as a consequence a negative rrt-pcr should not lead to the false assumption that the patient is not infected by sars-cov-2 and clinical parameters need to be considered 20 22 
 to avoid false-negative results due to testing failures standardized collection transport conditions storage extraction and amplification procedures of patient material are needed
 interestingly thermal inactivation reduced the detectable amount of sars-cov-2 in rrt-pcr runs and would be expected also for our ms test
 on the other hand inactivation by guanidinium-based lysis exhibited less effects 23 
besides rrt-pcr gold standard alternative techniques such as isothermal amplification methods and ms are available for the detection of viruses 24 25 
 ms has been successfully used for the detection of viral dna rna or proteins in previous studies 26 27 28 
 the method is fast with a turnaround time of max
 1 day and therefore suitable for routine use 29 
 however to the best of our knowledge there have been no reports on the application of ms for the detection of sars-cov-2 to date
 we show that i rrt-pcr is the fastest method to detect sars-cov-2 ii hands-on-time is comparable between rrt-pcr and the ms method and iii results are concordant between both assays
in summary we report on the application of ms as a reliable and fast method for the detection of sars-cov-2
 since there is a shortage of reagents at several places alternative methods that complement rrt-pcr and are dependent on alternative reagents are highly beneficial to tackle the 2020 covid-19 pandemic
 
 specific guidance for immunocompromised patients regarding covid-19 was pushed out quickly
 appointments for immunocompromised patients were converted to virtual visits or deferred if possible before appointments for other patients
 however the data thus far has not borne this out
 a hyperinflammatory response to covid-19 may cause a cytokine storm syndrome driving severe and deadly cases of covid-19
 advanced older age as a risk factor for covid-19 infection and death has been well substantiated
 1 lay press articles paint the at risk elderly as our grandparents nursing home residents or retirees
 14 the case fatality rate for individuals in the 60-69 age group was an unreassuring 3
6 in china and hospitalizations in this age group are extremely common
0003793cf9e709bc2b9d0c8111186f78fb73fc04   how do we protect our high-risk patient populations this was the dominant focus of our coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 neurology departmental meeting at the start of the epidemic weeks ago where a neurologist in his late 50s assured us we were at minimal danger from coronavirus and our efforts should focus on protecting our high-risk patients
 but do we know exactly who these high-risk people are although there was limited data to guide them our hospital the cdc 1 and various medical associations repeated the intuitive refrain that high risk patients are the immunocompromised and elderly
a hospital-wide high-risk patient working group was established early on consisting of neuroimmunologists and other physicians across disciplines that care for immunocompromised individuals
 specific guidance for immunocompromised patients regarding covid-19 was pushed out quickly
 appointments for immunocompromised patients were converted to virtual visits or deferred if possible before appointments for other patients
the inclusion of immunocompromised patients in the high-risk population for covid-19 is intuitive-immunosuppression should make a person more likely to contract an infection and may prolong the disease course
 however the data thus far has not borne this out
 early analyses of large chinese cohorts have identified risk factors such as older age hypertension chronic respiratory diseases and cardiovascular diseases but not immunosuppression as risk factors for disease severity in covid-19
 2 in addition data on prior related coronavirus outbreaks in mers 3 and sars 4 did not show any evidence of increased risk of infection or morbidity in immunocompromised populations
with the current outbreak reports of 2 heart transplant recipients 5 and the first renal transplant recipient 6 with covid-19 infection showed a clinical course recovery and laboratory profile similar to that of immunocompetent patients
 a pediatric liver transplant center in italy reported no significant pulmonary disease from covid-19 amongst their patients with autoimmune liver disease on chemotherapy or those who were post-transplant
 7 an analysis from china did note increased rates of infection and morbidity in cancer patients 8 however it did not adjust for age included patients many years out from their cancer treatments and has been the subject of several responses that contest the conclusion of increased risk to cancer patients
 910 indeed one response raised the point that decreased access to quality medical care rather than the virus itself is the primary danger facing cancer patients in the current pandemic
 10 no data exists regarding other transplant rheumatologic or neuroimmunological conditions which itself prompts the question of whether these patients are indeed at higher risk than the general population
not only has evidence that immunosuppression causes increased risk in covid-19 been lacking there is also a theoretical argument that immunosuppression may be therapeutic
 a hyperinflammatory response to covid-19 may cause a cytokine storm syndrome driving severe and deadly cases of covid-19
 11 clinical investigations into the utility of various immunosuppressive agents in covid-19 including tocilizumab an il-6 inhibitor janus kinus jak inhibitors and others are ongoing
 12 instead of focusing on immunosuppression we need to re-consider who qualifies as an elderly person in regards to covid-19 risk
 advanced older age as a risk factor for covid-19 infection and death has been well substantiated
 over 1 out of 5 patients in italy over the age of 80 succumbed to the disease 13 and according to the cdc 31-70 of confirmed covid-19 patients over the age of 85 in the united states require hospitalization
 1 lay press articles paint the at risk elderly as our grandparents nursing home residents or retirees
 and yet while the very elderly in their 80s are most severely affected by the disease the median age of hospitalized patients with severe covid-19 in a large retrospective study in china was only 52 years
 14 the case fatality rate for individuals in the 60-69 age group was an unreassuring 3
5 in italy and 3
6 in china and hospitalizations in this age group are extremely common
 13 morbidity may peak in societys oldest members but anyone older than 50 is far from safe and many in this group represent our health care workers grocery store employees government leaders caregivers and other members of society serving essential functions in the midst of this crisis
 unlike immunocompromised individuals average adults in their 50s or 60s may never have thought of themselves as vulnerable thus messaging about their elevated risk should be targeted and unambiguous
the data regarding risk factors for poor outcomes in covid-19 is far from definitive-as we learn more about this disease we may find that certain cancers neuroimmunologic conditions or immunosuppressive agents do indeed increase morbidity
 the medical complexity of some immunocompromised patients may itself lead to higher risk for nosocomial infections or complications related to hospitalization
 those in their 80s and 90s are at the highest risk from this infection and we must do everything we can to protect them
 however as health professionals focus on immunocompromised and elderly patients in our public health messaging we send an implicit message that others have made explicit that those outside of these groups are safer
 paradoxically the physician in his late 50s speaking about protecting high-risk immunocompromised patients at our hospital meeting may himself be at higher risk than many of the immunocompromised patients he seeks to protect
 these issues are consequential-some multiple sclerosis patients are considering delays in their immunosuppressive regimens due to the pandemic older healthcare workers are coming out of retirement to work on the frontlines and there is ongoing debate in government about the who will be at risk when we reopen society
 it is time to urgently begin the discussion within the medical community on how to target accurate messaging to those at highest risk

hereafter the term nanoparticle collectively refers to nanowires nws nanospheres nss and nanoflakes nfs
 this planar assembly was vacuum-formed into the desired surface geometry  fig

 the dependence of interconnect resistance and shape on the forming strain fls fluence and nanomaterial shape are examined
 in particular variation in nanomaterial shape is affected by mixing nws nss  nfs in different concentrations
 the process capability is further demonstrated via a simple conformal led-lighting circuit for relatively complex 3d surfaces
 nw-nf inks were also prepared in a similar method with the aforementioned concentrations
 printing nanomaterials of this concentration and size has also been performed by largearea printheads without a mask 16 
 during printing the sample stage was preheated to 70⁰c to quickly evaporate the ethanol
 for process characterization the printed pattern was a straight-line interconnect
 the in-plane stage motion was controlled by g-codes
 the number of printing passes was maintained at 140 in order to retain similar interconnect thickness across different samples
 the tg for pc was measured using differential scanning calorimetry to be 153 ℃

 1 c was used to characterize the effect of nanomaterial compositions on post-forming resistance
 this setup was adapted so that uniaxial strain was imposed on the interconnect along the pyramid slope
 the vacuum-forming process took about 30 seconds to complete
 this vacuum-formed assembly was subjected to fls sinteron 3000 system xenon corporation
 this lamp has a minimum optical footprint and therefore working area of 1-foot x 1 inch
 in this equation q depends on distance d the fraction of total optical irradiance at given wavelength λ i
4 denotes the total optical irradiance at a given voltage at the focal plane as specified by the manufacturer
 the base of the formed pc was fixed at 0
5 inches away from the lamp focal plane and the lamp voltage was fixed at 3 kv
 the focal plane of the light is located at 1 inch from the lamp casing
 the optical fluence at the pc base was varied as 57  9 jcm 2  with single optical pulse
 the interconnect morphology was analyzed via scanning electron micrography sem zeiss sigma field emission 8100
 the optical absorption of thedeposited ag nws was measured using an uv-vis spectrophotometer
 the sintering temperature was measured with an optical pyrometer
 post-fls resistance decreases with increase in optical fluence for all configurations
 the blowoff occurs due to nanoscale degradation and evaporation of nws beyond a limiting fluence 15 
 however for samples mixed with higher ns or nf content are less prone to fls induced damage
 3a -d show sem images after forming and after fls
 clustering of nfs or nss at nw-nw junctions is observable
 the size of the aggregate formation is bigger at higher concentrations for both nfs and nss
 lower number of contact points and higher neck growth is desirable for better percolation of electrons 20 21 
 also interconnects containing nw-ns or nw-nf mixtures sustain higher optical fluence energy than pure nws
 it is observed that the nw-nf configuration samples have greater optical absorption than other samples
 pure nws showed very low optical absorption characteristics
 this is because nfs have greater optical absorption than nws 22 23 
 therefore nw-nf ensemble results in greater optical absorption characteristics than only nws
 this phenomenon is applicable to nw-ns mixtures as well
 sintering temperatures were measured at the root section of the formed samples for 5jcm 2 optical fluence  fig
 the 25 nf sample had the highest sintering temperature at 237
5 ⁰c and pure nws sample had the lowest sintering temperature at 193
 figure 4 b shows that sintering temperatures increase with greater non-nw content for both nw-nf and nw-ns configurations
 the lowest post-fls resistance here ≈ 10 ωcm resistivity of 55
 thus fls plays a key role in compensating for the increase in resistance after vacuum-forming
 the change in resistivity with respect to forming angle is plotted in figure 4 c
 it is observed that change in resistivities post-forming  post-fls are comparable at lower forming angles 30⁰  40⁰
 at higher forming angles 50⁰  60⁰ the change in resistivity is non-linear
 this is due to greater strain on the nws as the forming angle increases

 the pcinterconnect assemblies were adhesively integrated with the mold surface and connected to an led-photoresistor circuit
this paper discusses the influence of nanomaterial shape morphology on line resistance in the form-fuse process
 this leads to greater nw-nw neck growth and resulted in observed post-fls resistance decrease

 for process characterization the printed pattern was a straight-line interconnect
 the in-plane stage motion was controlled by g-codes
 after depositing the interconnect pattern the printed substrate was taken out of the ajp stage and the mask was removed from the substrate  fig
 1d 
 the number of printing passes was maintained at 140 in order to retain similar interconnect thickness across different samples
 the interconnect-pc assembly was then thermoformed to the given mold shape by heating it above the polymers glass-transition temperature tg
 the tg for pc was measured using differential scanning calorimetry to be 153 ℃
 the mold was designed with air suction ducts and fabricated with polyetherimide using stereolithography based 3d printing
 mold with a truncated pyramid cross-section and aspect ratio widthheight of 2
5 characterized by a maximum mold angle θm  60⁰  fig
 1 c was used to characterize the effect of nanomaterial compositions on post-forming resistance
 the pc-interconnect assembly was aligned such that one end of the interconnect is on the top section and the other end is located at the root section of the mold
 this setup was adapted so that uniaxial strain was imposed on the interconnect along the pyramid slope
 during our experiments the mold was completely raised so that the polymer substrate pc was made to wrap the mold
 the fixed pc was heated to 200℃ as measured by a thermal camera and then vacuum-formed to the mold shape
 the vacuum-forming process took about 30 seconds to complete
 this vacuum-formed assembly was subjected to fls sinteron 3000 system xenon corporation
 this lamp has a minimum optical footprint and therefore working area of 1-foot x 1 inch
 the thermal power density q absorbed at an arbitrary location on the 3d interconnect was obtained as shown in eq
 1
 in this equation q depends on distance d the fraction of total optical irradiance at given wavelength λ i
e
 xλ ratio of absorbed power pa λ to incident power pi λ on the interconnect and the lamp voltage v in kv
 the term v3120 2
4 denotes the total optical irradiance at a given voltage at the focal plane as specified by the manufacturer
 the base of the formed pc was fixed at 0
5 inches away from the lamp focal plane and the lamp voltage was fixed at 3 kv
 the focal plane of the light is located at 1 inch from the lamp casing
 the optical fluence at the pc base was varied as 57  9 jcm 2  with single optical pulse
 the interconnect resistance was quantified by attaching copper tapes with highly conductive silver paste to the end-pads of the interconnects
 the interconnect morphology was analyzed via scanning electron micrography sem zeiss sigma field emission 8100
 the optical absorption of thedeposited ag nws was measured using an uv-vis spectrophotometer
 the sintering temperature was measured with an optical pyrometer
 post-fls resistance decreases with increase in optical fluence for all configurations
 at higher fluence 9jcm 2  blowoff is visually observed in pure ag nw cases as in past work 17 18 
 the blowoff occurs due to nanoscale degradation and evaporation of nws beyond a limiting fluence 15 
 the missing data points in figures 2c and 2f denote that there is no conductivity across the interconnect to measure resistance
 however for samples mixed with higher ns or nf content are less prone to fls induced damage
 figs
 3a -d show sem images after forming and after fls
 clustering of nfs or nss at nw-nw junctions is observable
 the size of the aggregate formation is bigger at higher concentrations for both nfs and nss
 these clusters were observed across the interconnect after deposition and are caused due to the presence of surface defects on the nanoflakes  nanospheres 19 
 lower number of contact points and higher neck growth is desirable for better percolation of electrons 20 21 
 figure 2 shows that the change in line resistance between post-forming and post-fls is much greater in mixed configurations and further increases with an increase in nf or ns content than pure nw samples
 also interconnects containing nw-ns or nw-nf mixtures sustain higher optical fluence energy than pure nws
 400 to 700 nm
 it is observed that the nw-nf configuration samples have greater optical absorption than other samples
 pure nws showed very low optical absorption characteristics
 this is because nfs have greater optical absorption than nws 22 23 
 therefore nw-nf ensemble results in greater optical absorption characteristics than only nws
 this phenomenon is applicable to nw-ns mixtures as well
 sintering temperatures were measured at the root section of the formed samples for 5jcm 2 optical fluence  fig
  4b 
 the 25 nf sample had the highest sintering temperature at 237
5 ⁰c and pure nws sample had the lowest sintering temperature at 193
2 ⁰c
 figure 4 b shows that sintering temperatures increase with greater non-nw content for both nw-nf and nw-ns configurations
 hence it is safe to assume that the incident optical energy from the flash lamp is effectively absorbed by the nss or nfs
 the heat generated due to optical absorption is transferred to nw-nw junctions to facilitate interparticle neck growth thus resulting in a greater change in post-fls line resistance for nw-ns or nw-nf samples as shown in figure 2 
 thus nanomaterial shape plays a key role in reducing the line resistance after fls so that neck growth induced reduction in resistance due to fls can overcome the concurrent increase in resistance due to vacuum-forming
 the lowest post-fls resistance here ≈ 10 ωcm resistivity of 55
4 µω-cm is achieved in pure ag nw samples sintered at 5jcm 2 optical energy  fig 5a  which is considered as the optimal fluence in this work
 in order to achieve lower manufacturing costs interconnects containing nw-ns mixtures and sintered at higher fluence can be used to achieve resistance similar to that of pure nws sample
 but if the optical fluence or the ns content is greater than a certain optimum the resistance will increase due to blowoff
 thus fls plays a key role in compensating for the increase in resistance after vacuum-forming
 the change in resistivity with respect to forming angle is plotted in figure 4 c
 it is observed that change in resistivities post-forming  post-fls are comparable at lower forming angles 30⁰  40⁰
 at higher forming angles 50⁰  60⁰ the change in resistivity is non-linear
 this is due to greater strain on the nws as the forming angle increases
 our process with optimal parameters was used to integrate conductive interconnects on more complex surfaces such as the stepped geometry  fig
  5a  and the concavo-convex geometry fig 5b 
 the pcinterconnect assemblies were adhesively integrated with the mold surface and connected to an led-photoresistor circuit
this paper discusses the influence of nanomaterial shape morphology on line resistance in the form-fuse process
 addition of nss or nfs in nws expand the useable fluence range by alleviating blowoff but at the cost of lower conductivity
 the non-linear dependence of line-resistance on the addition of nss or nfs was explained using sem characterization uv-vis spectroscopy and temperature measurements
 uv-vis and temperature measurements show that addition of nfs or nss results in greater optical absorption due to size and shape effects
 this leads to greater nw-nw neck growth and resulted in observed post-fls resistance decrease
 note that the scale of this form-fuse process can be increased by using large area printheads along with commercial vacuum-forming machines and linearly placed sintering lamps
 the demonstrated process also enables high throughput and circuit repairability and wide material window which makes this process versatile and independent of object size and shape
 however there are several unanswered questions such as why is there a significant change in line resistance from post-forming to post-fls for samples containing nfs or nss when compared to nws only cases does localized optical absorption or sintering kinetics or both drive this change the reasoning behind these questions will be discussed in our future work

the characteristics of the 20 sars patients are summarized in table 1

 oseltamivir tamiflu was also given initially to treat possible influenza infection
the longitudinal trends of plasma th1th2 cytokines and inflammatory cytokines of the 20 sars patients are illustrated in fig
 in contrast there was no significant increase in proinflammatory cytokine tnf-a in all sars patients
 anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 was found to increase in some but not all patients no overall significance
 the other seven patients had milder disease severity and were not treated with pulsed steroid
 these 5-8-day post-treatment concentrations were also significantly lower than those of 1-2 days after treatment all p  0·05
this study was designed to investigate prospectively the longitudinal plasma cytokine and chemokine profile of adult patients with sars
 il-6 may play a proinflammatory role in pulmonary inflammation 23 
 il-12 can induce the production of ifn-g and other th1 cytokines with suppression of the th2 pathway 26 27 
 therefore pmn-induced acute pneumonitis should be crucial in the pathogenesis of ards and pulmonary destruction in sars patients
 consistently our results showed that both circulating ifn-g and ip-10 were increased in sars patients
 these suggest that sars-cov does not enhance the th2 pathway and the subsequent humoral immue response
 such imbalance of th1th2 cytokine profile confirms the sars-covinduced th1 predominance
 in contrast to h5n1 infection 15  plasma tnf-a was not elevated in our patients
 this finding therefore does not support the therapeutic use of tnf-a monoclonal antibody for sars
 however it must be cautioned that the concentration of tnf-a at the pulmonary inflammatory sites has not been investigated
 moreover the t cell chemokines mig and rantes also did not show any significantly elevation
 this further supports that the above cytokines and chemokines played impor-tant roles in the immunopathological mechanisms of sars
 we have initiated a study comparing plasma cytokines and chemokines in sars patients with and without corticosteroid treatment
 therefore the role of tgf-b in sars also requires investigation
00039b94e6cb7609ecbddee1755314bcfeb77faa  severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is a recently emerged infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus but its immunopathological mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated
 we investigated changes in plasma t helper th cell cytokines inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in 20 patients diagnosed with sars
 cytokine profile of sars patients showed marked elevation of th1 cytokine interferon ifn-g  inflammatory cytokines interleukin il-1 il-6 and il-12 for at least 2 weeks after disease onset but there was no significant elevation of inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor tnf-a  anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 th1 cytokine il-2 and th2 cytokine il-4
 the chemokine profile demonstrated significant elevation of neutrophil chemokine il-8 monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mcp-1 and th1 chemokine ifn-g -inducible protein-10 ip-10
 corticosteroid reduced significantly il-8 mcp-1 and ip-10 concentrations from 5 to 8 days after treatment all p  0·001
 together the elevation of th1 cytokine ifn-g  inflammatory cytokines il-1 il-6 and il-12 and chemokines il-8 mcp-1 and ip-10 confirmed the activation of th1 cell-mediated immunity and hyperinnate inflammatory response in sars through the accumulation of monocytesmacrophages and neutrophils
 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is a recently emerged infectious disease characterized by persistent fever respiratory symptoms with lung consolidation lymphopenia and respiratory failure in life-threatening cases 1 2 3 4 
 watery diarrhoea has also been manifested in some cases 5 
 we found that lymphopenia and depletion of cd4 and cd8 t lymphocytes could be associated with disease activity and adverse outcomes in sars 4 
 the sars-related deaths have resulted mainly from pulmonary complications including progressive respiratory failure due to alveolar damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards
 the causative agent of sars has been identified as a new coronavirus sars-cov 6 7 8 with a genome sequence that is only moderately related to other known coronaviruses 9 10 
 rapid diagnostic tests using molecular techniques for the detection of sars-cov rna have been developed recently 11 12 
 administration of the antiviral drug ribarivin together with systemic corticosteroid resulted in alleviation of inflammation reduction of organ dysfunction and improvement on survival in the majority of sars patients 1 5 13  although controlled clinical trials are required to confirm this regimens genuine efficacy
it has been shown that the over-production of specific inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor tnf-a  interleukin il-1 b  il-6 il-10 and polymorphonuclear neutrophil pmn cc chemokine il-8 is the hallmark of viral infection probably through the activation of transcription factor nuclear factor nf-k b activator protein ap-1 and activating factor-2 atf-2 14 
 for example the h5n1 avian flu influenza viruses are potent inducers of proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf-a in macrophages 15 
 in swine pneumonia the production of tnf-a and il-6 was found to correlate positively with disease severity 16 
 therefore sars sequalae such as transendothelial migration of pmn into lung tissue multiple organ dysfunction and ards have been postulated to associate with cytokine and chemokine dysregulation 17 18 
 in an attempt to study possible sars-cov-induced cytokine and chemokine dysregulation to identify markers for disease severity and to explore the feasibility of designing effective treatment strategy such as anti-cytokine therapy we have prospectively investigated a panel of circulating t helper th cell cytokines inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in patients with sars
our study included 20 consecutive adult patients who were diagnosed to have sars and admitted to the prince of wales hospi-tal hong kong for treatment from 20 march to 11 april 2003

 the diagnosis of sars was confirmed by an indirect immunofluorescence assay with fetal rhesus kidney cells that were infected with coronavirus and fixed in acetone to detect a serological response to the sars-cov 7  or by a positive viral culture
 our protocol was approved by the clinical research ethics committee of the chinese university of hong kong and informed consent was obtained from all participants

 because the more commonly used procedure of enzymelinked immunosorbent assay elisa may generate infectious droplets and aerosols t helper th1th2 cytokines inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in plasma were measured serially by cytometric bead array cba using a four-colour facscalibur flow cytometer becton dickinson ca usa located in a biosafety level ii laboratory 20 21 
 in cba five or six bead populations with distinct fluorescence intensities had been coated with capturing antibodies specific for different cytokines or chemokines
 these bead populations could be resolved in the fluorescence channels of the flow cytometer
 after the beads had been incubated with 50 m l of plasma different cytokines or chemokines in the sample were captured by their corresponding beads
 the cytokinechemokine captured beads were then mixed with phycoerythrin-conjugated detection antibodies to form sandwich complexes
 following incubation washing and acquisition of fluorescence data the results were generated in graphical format using the bd cba software

 the coefficients of variation for all cytokine and chemokine assays were less than 10
 their respective normal ranges have been derived from measurement of ≥ 100 healthy subjects

the characteristics of the 20 sars patients are summarized in table 1 
 coincidentally all except one were female patients although the female-to-male ratio of the 1755 sars patients in this outbreak in hong kong as well as that of the 290 patients none of the 20 sars patients recruited in this study died or required admission to the intensive care unit icu
 initial treatment included antibiotics cefotaxime and clarithromycin or levofloxacin to cover common pathogens causing community-acquired pneumonia
 oseltamivir tamiflu was also given initially to treat possible influenza infection
 after fever had persisted for more than 48 h and leukopenia thrombocytopenia or both had developed oral ribavirin 40-60 mgkgday and oral prednisolone 1 mgkgday were started as a combined regimen from 2 to 9 days after disease fever onset
 patients who did not respond clinically to standard empirical treatment including persistent fever increasing shortness of breath worsening lung opacities involving  50 of lung field in chest radiograph and deteriorating oxygen saturation to  90 by pulse oximetry were given intravenous ribavirin 400 mg every 8 h and an additional one to three pulses of 0·5 g of methylprednisolone sodium succinate methylprednisolone daily
the longitudinal trends of plasma th1th2 cytokines and inflammatory cytokines of the 20 sars patients are illustrated in fig

 th1 cytokine ifn-g and inflammatory cytokines il-1 b  il-6 and il-12 concentrations were significantly elevated above their normal range respectively within the first 12 7 and 5 days after disease onset all p  0·05
 in contrast there was no significant increase in proinflammatory cytokine tnf-a in all sars patients
 anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 was found to increase in some but not all patients no overall significance
 the plasma concentrations of th1 cytokine il-2 and th2 cytokine il-4 of all patients were low and within their respective normal range at all time points data not shown
 as shown in fig
 2  plasma pmn cc chemokine il-8 monocyte cc chemokine mcp-1 and th1 cxc chemokine ip-10 concentrations were elevated respectively within the first 9 3 and 14 days after disease onset all p  0·05
 the overall plasma concentrations of t cell chemoattractants namely cxc chemokine mig and cc chemokine rantes were not significantly elevated
among the 20 sars patients in our cohort 13 had more severe disease activity including persistent fever and worsening lung opacities they were additionally given intravenous pulsed methylprednisolone
 the other seven patients had milder disease severity and were not treated with pulsed steroid
 figure 3 shows that plasma ifn-g  il-1 b  il-6 il-8 ip-10 and mcp-1 of the former group of patients had higher median concentrations than those of the latter particularly from day 3-10 after disease onset
 following recovery the cytokine and chemokine levels decreased progressively to normal values at about 1 week after disease onset for both groups of patients
as summarized in table 2  plasma chemokine il-8 ip-10 and mcp-1 were significantly reduced to their respective normal ranges from 5 to 8 days after corticosteroid treatment compared to the elevated pretreatment levels all p  0·005
 these 5-8-day post-treatment concentrations were also significantly lower than those of 1-2 days after treatment all p  0·05
 all the other measured cytokines and chemokines il-1 b  il-6 il-10 il-12p70 tnf-a  ifn-g  rantes and mig did not show any significant difference before and after corticosteroid treatment
this study was designed to investigate prospectively the longitudinal plasma cytokine and chemokine profile of adult patients with sars
 the progression of this potentially lethal disease may be represented by three phases acute viral multiplication hyperactive immune response recovery or pulmonary destruction and death 1 4 5 
 accordingly it is worthwhile to investigate cytokine and chemokine induction which may be the cause or consequence of immune hyperactivity in sars
 we observed that for at least 2 weeks after disease onset all sars patients exhibited a significant increase in the typical antiviral th1 cytokine ifn-g and an array of proinflammatory cytokines il-1 b  il-6 and il-12 together with a moderate increase in anti-inflammatory il-10 that was manifested in some patients
 il-1 b can act as the early response cytokine to viral infection such as that caused by the human immunodeficiency virus for mediation of inflammatory response synthesis of acute phase proteins and release of il-8 14 22 
 il-6 may play a proinflammatory role in pulmonary inflammation 23 
 th2 cytokine il-10 is an antiinflammatory cytokine that suppresses the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines 24  therefore it was elevated in some patients 1 week after disease onset and followed the elevation of other inflammatory cytokines
 il-12 also known as natural killer nk cell stimulatory factor or cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor is a pleiotropic proinflammatory cytokine which is produced primarily by antigen-presenting cells monocytes macrophages dendritic cells and b cells and pmn 25 
 il-12 can induce the production of ifn-g and other th1 cytokines with suppression of the th2 pathway 26 27 
 it has multiple effects on t lymphocytes and nk cells including the ability to stimulate cytotoxicity proliferation cytokine production and the development of th1 subsets 28 29 
 therefore the observed early elevation of inflammatory cytokines il-1 b  il-6 il-12 and ifn-g could be causative of the sars-cov-induced activation of th1 cells and nk cells release of chemokines such as il-8 and results in pulmonary inflammation 16 
a previous study has suggested that the infiltration of proinflammatory pmn is involved in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury 30 
 pmn are abundant in the airspaces of most ards patients with infection and their secretory products such as myeloperoxidase and elastase in bronchoalveolar lavage bal fluid can cause acute lung injury 31 32 33 
 il-8 the pmn achemokine has been shown to be elevated in blood and alveolar spaces 34 and exhibit a positive correlation with the number of pmn in bal fluid of patients with pneumonia and ards 35 
 our sars-cov-infected patients also showed elevation of plasma il-8 soon after disease onset which declined from 5 to 8 days after corticosteroid treatment
 in our former clinical study 82 of 157 sars patients developed neutrophilia and the high neutrophil counts were associated with icu admission and mortality from pneumonia 4 
 therefore pmn-induced acute pneumonitis should be crucial in the pathogenesis of ards and pulmonary destruction in sars patients
apart from the a -chemokine il-8 we have also observed elevation of the monocytemacrophages b -chemokine mcp-1 soon after the onset of sars followed by decline after corticosteroid treatment
 mcp-1 concentration has been shown to increase in bal fluid of patients with persistent ards 36  correlating positively with the predominance of alveolar macrophages 37 that has also been found in the postmortem examination of sars patients 2 38 
 ip-10 is a specific chemoattractant for th1 cells for the activation of cell-mediated immune response its expression can be up-regulated by the th1 cytokine ifn-g in acute lung inflammation 39 
 consistently our results showed that both circulating ifn-g and ip-10 were increased in sars patients
 our observation of low or normal th2 cytokine il-4 in sars patients is also similar to the finding of a previous study of viral pneumonia 40 
 these suggest that sars-cov does not enhance the th2 pathway and the subsequent humoral immue response
 such imbalance of th1th2 cytokine profile confirms the sars-covinduced th1 predominance
 in contrast to h5n1 infection 15  plasma tnf-a was not elevated in our patients
 this finding therefore does not support the therapeutic use of tnf-a monoclonal antibody for sars
 however it must be cautioned that the concentration of tnf-a at the pulmonary inflammatory sites has not been investigated
 previous studies have implicated that inflammatory il-b and the acute-phase cytokine il-6 are endogenous pyrogens or inducers of fever 41 
 therefore elevations of il-b and il-6 might account for the fever onset as both of them were found to have high plasma concentrations during the first week of disease
 moreover the t cell chemokines mig and rantes also did not show any significantly elevation
 therefore the recruitment of activated t cells in pulmonary tissue should be studied by performing chemokine assay and differential cell count in bal fluids although this should be difficult because of the high risk of infection
in summary we postulate that the elevation of the plasma chemokines il-8 mcp-1 and ip-10 th1-related cytokine ifn-g and il-12 and inflammatory cytokines il-1b and il-6 can induce the hyperinnate inflammatory response due to the sars-cov invasion of the respiratory tract
 this leads to the recruitment and accumulation of alveolar macrophages and pmn 42  as well as the activation of th1 cell-mediated immunity by the stimulation of nk and cytotoxic t lymphocytes ctl
 treatment with immunosuppressive corticosteroid can significantly suppress the elevated chemokines il-8 ip-10 and mcp-1 and subsequently alleviate the chemokine-associated pulmonary inflammation in sars
 indeed the reduction in il-8 ip-10 and mcp-1 correlated with the improvement in general clinical condition pulmonary function and radiological appearance in sars patients of our present study
 in addition we also observed that higher disease severity was associated with more elevated plasma ifn-g il-1b il-6 il-8 ip-10 and mcp-1 concentrations fig
 3 
 it can be postulated that the addition of pulsed steroid in the severe-disease group not only controlled the rapidly deteriorating clinical condition but basically attenuated the otherwise over-exaggerated immunological response with potentially much high median concentrations of plasma cytokines and chemokines
 this further supports that the above cytokines and chemokines played impor-tant roles in the immunopathological mechanisms of sars
 we have initiated a study comparing plasma cytokines and chemokines in sars patients with and without corticosteroid treatment
 the elevated plasma cytokines and chemokines should also shed light on the possibility of using them as prognostic indicators for disease severity in sars
 for example the presence of high anti-il-8  il-8 complexes in bal fluid has been shown to be an important prognostic indicator for ards 43 
although our study has provided some understanding of the immunological mechanisms of inflammation in sars and the therapeutic effects of corticosteroid many further investigations are required to explore the detailed pathophysiology of this novel emerging disease with global impact
 in order to correlate cytokine release with disease severity in vitro mechanistic study of cytokine induction using sars-cov and immune cell culture and eventually the measurement of cytokine and chemokine concentrations at local inflammatory sites should be contemplated
 other chemokines such as epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide ena-78 a neutrophil chemoattractant 30  and macrophage inflammatory peptide-1 alpha mip-1a a monocyte chemoattractant 30  should be measured
 recently transforming growth factor tgf-b has been shown to be active early in acute lung injury and potentially contribute to the development of pulmonary oedema 44 
 therefore the role of tgf-b in sars also requires investigation
 given the prominent roles of cytokines and chemokines in the pathogenesis of sars anticytokine chemokine immunotherapy using anticytokinechemokine antibodies e

 anti-il-8 anti-mcp-1 or cytokinechemokine antagonists may represent a novel approach for the treatment of hyperactive inflammation in sars 45 46

 in chicago one of the nations hotspots african american make up 42 of the cases and 56 of the deaths from the virus 1 there are several pathways that contribute to racial disparities in covid-19 cases and death
first we must consider biological underpinnings that are specific to covid-19
 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is the entry receptor utilized by covid-19 and is thought to negatively regulate the activated renin-angiotensin system by diverting the generation of vasoconstrictor angiotensin ii angii towards the inactive ang 1-9 and vasodilatatory ang 1-7 peptides
 a few studies have found racial differences in ace2 activity showing african americans produce higher levels of angii and demonstrate lower ace2 activity 3 
 studies have shown that downregulation of ace2 expression is involved in lung pathology after sars-cov infection and elevations in angii have been directly related to covid-19 severity 4 
 hence dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system may place african americans at disproportionate risk for severe covid-19 outcomes
the second and perhaps most critical factor relates to health disparities
 african americans disproportionally account for 45 of vascular-related diseases and are 37 more likely to develop lung cancer than whites despite lower exposure to cigarette smoke
 social determinant factors like economic stability education and the environment directly impact issues related to access and quality of health care which fuel health disparities
 furthermore there is evidence of medical bias in the testing and treatment of african-american with covid-we must ask ourselves why do these social inequities persist despite decades of scientific evidence showing its damaging effects on health we believe the answer lies in a close examination of structural forms of racism and discrimination towards african americans
historically african americans have been a target group for racism and discrimination which has created a deep mistrust for societal systems -often undermined as paranoia
 specific to covid-19 african americans are overrepresented in essential jobs therefore employment may interfere with the ability to stay at home and social distance

 first altered immune function hypothalamic-pituitary axis hpa dysfunction and metabolic changes secondary to stress can contribute to medical co-morbidities such as type 2 diabetes hypertension and asthma all of which increase covid-19 risk
 everyday discrimination is a stressor that has been linked to poor health inflammation and premature cellular aging 6 
 hence discrimination experiences may also explain why african americans are at a disproportionately higher risk for poor medical e
g
 cardiovascular disease metabolic hypertension and psychiatric outcomes e
g
 depression anxiety
disparities in health outcomes may also reflect dysfunctions in the bodys innate immediate and adaptive prolonged immune responses which are evolutionarily designed to defend against and prevent the spread of pathogens
 during initial exposure to a new pathogen tolllike receptors play a critical role in innate and inflammatory immune responses
 dysfunctional alterations in the adaptive immune response may promote a cytokine storm whereby the immune system begins to attack its own cells and tissues 7 which has been seen in severe cases of covid-19
the field of social genomics has uncovered how certain marginalized groups demonstrate abnormal patterns of gene expression in genes responsible for innate immunity termed the conserved transcriptional response to adversity ctra 8 
 ctra refers to a common pattern of transcriptional alterations that is activated by chronic low-grade activation of the sympathetic nervous system sns
 the ctra profile is characterized by increased expression of genes involved in inflammation and decreased expression of genes involved in innate antiviral responses and genes encoding specific isotypes of antibodies igg in particular
 experiences of racial discrimination have been found to explain more than 50 of the black-white differences in ctra particularly in genes that promote inflammation 9 
 together these studies provide a potential pathway as to how racism and discrimination alter host innate immunity to promote abnormal inflammatory responses
the neuropsychiatric sequelae of covid-19 have both direct and indirect pathways
 the direct pathway relates to the stress-induced inflammatory factors as described above that may increase risk for encephalopathies depression anxiety and trauma-related disorders 10 
 it is hypothesized that these neuropsychiatric manifestations could result from the virus-induced cytokine storm
the indirect pathway relates to measures to address the pandemic like social distancing as well as the economic toll of covid-19
 there is growing concern that these indirect consequences of covid-19 may contribute to isolation anxiety depression and increased rates of suicide 11 
as a result of these direct and indirect pathways african americans are specifically vulnerable to the neuropsychiatric consequences of covid-19
the crisis generated by the covid-19 pandemic has forced us to confront issues of inequality and health disparities
 while considerable efforts are being made to flatten the curve it does not negate the damage that has already been done particularly in the african american community
 while the virus is not thought to target specific racial or ethnic groups we cannot ignore that african americans have been disproportionately impacted
 as we think about getting past this crisis and getting back to normal the pandemic provides an opportunity to improve our health system to reduce disparities
 in sum understanding the key biological and psychosocial contributors to the ravishes of covid-19 in african americans highlights the need for more vigilance attention and efforts to improve health for all
 
 the alliedness of this health care professional group is an evolving entity that can no longer be overlooked
 specific recommendations are offered to improve recognition of rts and their professional identity within the healthcare system
 despite these mounting challenges they remain steadfast and committed to patient-centered care
notably health team members are collaborating in an interprofessional cooperative and coordinated manner to provide efficient and exceptional care
 3 this is an especially impressive achievement during a global pandemic such as covid-19
 such connectedness is crucial in identifying meaningful pathways toward providing relevant timely and wise medical decisions and interventions
 such identity according to porter and wilton 5 is a key factor in the functioning of interprofessional teams
 the construction of professional identity is defined by professional spaces and symbols
 these spaces and symbols constitute the overall organizational space
this space according to halford and leonard 6 is more than a passive backdrop to hospital life
 the symbolic part of the profession is evident with the uniforms badges names and titles attached to the profession
 additionally a culture of subservience and apathy is prevalent in radiologic technology profession
 this phenomenon is largely due to the role that the medical profession has assumed
 this dominance has persisted since the early 1900s when a hierarchal system was created within radiology departments
 this effect created cultural norms that effectively limited the role of rts within the department
 rts are front-line patient-care staff who play a key role in preserving an effectively operating medical imaging department
 11 in addition this profession is one of the most dangerous in frontline healthcare
 12 rts are trained health professionals who produce highquality medical images for radiologists and physicians
 as such rts are equally indispensable members of the healthcare team deserving of a distinct professional identity
 the integral and pivotal role of rts cannot be underestimated
 the alliedness of this health care professional group is an evolving entity that cannot be overlooked
 for several years the outstanding contributions of teachers policemen soldiers journalists artists and firemen have already been recognized
0003ddfb7ce19bcb3f38907f69676163b9863535  the value of professional identity is an interesting territory to explore relative to working in interprofessional teams and collaborative communities the collaborative opportunities provided to health care workers during covid-19 pandemic is a rare opportunity to underscore the silent yet significant identity of radiologic technologists as professionals
 historically and prior to the pandemic the role of radiologic technologists remains unfamiliar if not unrecognized in the philippine healthcare industry
 the alliedness of this health care professional group is an evolving entity that can no longer be overlooked
 the central and indispensable role played by radiologic technologists rts invites meaningful discussion and debate among peers and researchers to better describe the professional identity and role of the rt as an indispensable member of the interprofessional team
 specific recommendations are offered to improve recognition of rts and their professional identity within the healthcare system
 considered as the most important asset in the prevention and control of covid-19 1 the role that healthcare workers play in this global pandemic gives a renewed meaning of what true human service is all about
 healthcare workers face a wide array of risks and uncertainties in their day-to-day responsibilities as they do battle with covid-19
 despite these mounting challenges they remain steadfast and committed to patient-centered care
with the department of healths doh interim guidelines for emergency hiring of health personnel as the countrys clear and appropriate response to the covid-19 health emergency 2 the many members of the healthcare system are undoubtedly teeming with pride
 countless numbers of professionals are now adequately staffed and fueled with profound expertise good will and driven by an inspiring spirit of collaboration
notably health team members are collaborating in an interprofessional cooperative and coordinated manner to provide efficient and exceptional care
 3 this is an especially impressive achievement during a global pandemic such as covid-19
 protected with goggles gowns and gloves 3gs all healthcare professionals silently but competently work together to deliver life-giving life-sustaining and life-reviving services that make them an integral and highly connected system
 such connectedness is crucial in identifying meaningful pathways toward providing relevant timely and wise medical decisions and interventions
 this highly connected system among healthcare professionals is what touati et al 4 collectively call a collaborative community where reliance on rationality enables members to strategically coordinate their activities through a shared commitment to a set of ultimate goals
 though the word front liner is a generic label given to the healthcare professionals involved in combatting the perils of covid-19 the value of professional identity is an interesting territory to explore relative to working in interprofessional teams and collaborative communities
 such identity according to porter and wilton 5 is a key factor in the functioning of interprofessional teams
interestingly there is a growing attention paid to the substantial restructuring and banding of health professions from being referred to as allied to medicine to the emergence of a subculture where staff became allied to each other
 the construction of professional identity is defined by professional spaces and symbols
 these spaces and symbols constitute the overall organizational space
this space according to halford and leonard 6 is more than a passive backdrop to hospital life
 kolyva 7 for her part averred that a big difference exists between place and space with the former referring to the physical location and geography while the latter pertains to what is imagined and virtual
 though healthcare workers in a hospital or healthcare facility operate in the same building the practice of departmentalization creates a kind of physical and mental territoriality
 the symbolic part of the profession is evident with the uniforms badges names and titles attached to the profession
 interestingly the ways the material spaces are used and the meanings woven around hospital spaces who has which space how much space who can go where and for how long 6 8 are meaningful blocks that shape the professional identity that one assumes the meaningful interaction interrelatedness and interdependence of individuals in the context of space and materials form the identity that a particular profession assumes
the collaborative community and alliance of health care workers during covid-19 pandemic is a rare opportunity to underscore the silent yet significant identity of rts as professionals
 in fact even before this pandemic the role of radiologic technologists remains unfamiliar if not unrecognized in the philippine healthcare industry
 additionally a culture of subservience and apathy is prevalent in radiologic technology profession
 this phenomenon is largely due to the role that the medical profession has assumed
 this dominance has persisted since the early 1900s when a hierarchal system was created within radiology departments
 this effect created cultural norms that effectively limited the role of rts within the department
 this gap in professional identity and role has been compounded by the all too familiar just the radiographer syndrome leaving rts feeling intimidated worthless unappreciated and overlooked
 9 while healthcare professionals are deemed equally important with respect to the delivery of patient care woznitza hare and nair 10 recently emphasized that imaging departments provide uniquely vital support systems in the provision of care to patients during the covid-19 pandemic
 rts are front-line patient-care staff who play a key role in preserving an effectively operating medical imaging department
 11 in addition this profession is one of the most dangerous in frontline healthcare
 12 rts are trained health professionals who produce highquality medical images for radiologists and physicians
 as such rts are equally indispensable members of the healthcare team deserving of a distinct professional identity
 rts use critical thinking skills in the application of various imaging methods and procedures to assist physicians and other healthcare professionals in diagnosing andor monitoring a patients injury or illness
 13 in fact agadakos 11 asserted that basic imaging service like the chest ct is essential in assessing the early manifestation and progression of the covid-19 infection
clearly in a collaborative community approach all healthcare professions count and are equally essential in the war against the covid-19 pandemic
 the integral and pivotal role of rts cannot be underestimated
 the alliedness of this health care professional group is an evolving entity that cannot be overlooked
 the centrality of this silent yet important sector in the healthcare system invites the opening of avenues for interesting and meaningful colloquy and debates among scholars and research enthusiasts to unearth the dynamics of the professional identity of its members even after the pandemic
in conclusion the covid-19 pandemic has become an interesting lens to affirm the vital role that healthcare professionals play as a collaborative community
 though they are equally important in combatting the dangers of this health crisis this study underscores the silent and seemingly unrecognized space that rts occupy in the philippine healthcare system
 such space invites a closer examination on how professional identity as a dynamic phenomenon is developed as early as the university education and extends during the practice of the profession
 while the rt profession in the philippines is not as popular as the other allied-health disciplines like nursing pharmacy medical technology and rehabilitation sciences higher education institutions offering rt programs are challenged to institutionalise programs projects activities that would enable rt students to have a deeper understanding of self and the uniqueness of their field
 a good balance between technical skills acquisition and the development of a strong professional identity should be taken into consideration
 reflective exercises and opportunities to interact with other health professionals as early as university years could contribute to students professional identity development
 a programmatic research agenda that investigates the development of professional identity among future rts could be undertaken and be shared in professional gatherings to improve the delivery of the rt curriculum
while the philippine proclamation 194s
 of 1999 14 calls for the celebration of the national radiologic technology week that focuses public attention on the diagnostic and therapeutic uses of radiation the accompanying radiation hazard protection and the different modalities used in radiology the centrality and agency of the rts in the delivery of imaging services should not be overlooked
 today more than ever the important contributions of rts in the health care system in particular and in nation building in general implies the need to institutionalise a system of recognition through an excellence in rt practice award
 though professionals across disciplines are recognized through the yearly outstanding professional awards given by the philippine professional regulation commission the agency mandated to implement the regulatory laws and policies for the various regulated professions the award given by third-parties such as corporate foundations remains a blank spot in the field of rt
 for several years the outstanding contributions of teachers policemen soldiers journalists artists and firemen have already been recognized
 true enough the signaling function of these awards have afforded the public with heightened awareness and appreciation of the importance of these professionals in philippine society through media publicity
 also professional rt societies could spearhead the conduct of medical missions and other community extension services and engagements to increase the public presence of their members
 undoubtedly threading all efforts and initiatives from the university education to professional practice is a valuable way to strengthen the once neglected identity of rts in this part of the globe
  
 methods we conducted a prospective multicentre cohort study during the 200607 influenza season in berlin germany
 weekly mobile phone text messages were used to prompt participants to report respiratory illnesses during the influenza season
 a logistic regression model was used to assess the influence of potential risk factors
 results we recruited 250 hospital healthcare workers mean age 35
7 years and 486 non-healthcare workers mean age 39
2 years from administrative centres blood donors and colleges
 overall scii attack rate was 10
 being a healthcare worker was not a risk factor for scii relative risk 1
 the final multivariate model had three significant factors living with children odds ratio or 3

 living with three or more children or 13
01 was a greater risk than living with one or two children or 5
 30 of participants with scii reported no respiratory illness
 healthcare workers were at slightly higher risk of reporting any respiratory infection than controls adjusted or 1
 household contacts seem to be more important than exposure to patients
 car ownership is a surprise finding which needs further exploration
 asymptomatic infections are common accounting for around a third of serologically confirmed infections
 vaccination of hcws should theoretically reduce the risk of influenza infection both in themselves and their patients
 there is evidence to support the first reason for vaccination the protection of patients
 hcws can transmit influenza to those under their care during both outbreaks and non-outbreak situations 4 5 6 7 
 however not all serologically diagnosed influenza infections experience an influenza-like illness and a proportion will be asymptomatic
 hcws and some non-hcws were sought from the hospitals but only non-hcws were sought from all other sites
on recruitment before the influenza season consenting participants gave a single serum sample and completed an exposure questionnaire
 details recorded included age sex type of employment risk factors for influenza smoking status and vaccination status
 this strategy was employed in order to maximise the predictive value of a positive answer
after the influenza season participants were recalled by sms or email
 participants were asked to estimate the number of contacts made during a typical day in household and work settings
the primary outcome was evidence of scii by any of the above strains
 for the comparison of the exposure groups hcw vs
 non-hcw continuous variables were analysed using the kruskal-wallis test
 for the analysis of the association with scii continuous variables were explored by grouping them in categories
 we regarded a p-value of less than 0
 we then constructed a multivariate logistic regression model logistic command stata statacorp
 variables with p values between 0

 in 88486 18 the occupation was not stated or unclear
 table 1 compares study characteristics in the exposure group hcw and control group non-hcw
 hcws were significantly younger than controls 35
healthcare workers had significantly more non-patient contacts at work mean 14
021 but fewer contacts at home mean 2
01 there were no significant differences in immunisation in the previous three seasons or in household exposure to children
in total there were 82 titer rises among 78 participants
 there were four double-infections three with h3n2h1n1 coinfections and one with titre rises to both b strains

immunisation against influenza was associated with an or of 0
 vaccine effectiveness against scii was therefore 50 95ci 12-71
 effectiveness against scii with a reported ili was higher at 73 95ci 6-92 p  0
 other variables were added to the multivariate model but were found not to be significant at the p  0
 these were being a doctor having 7 or more child patient contacts and being a healthcare worker

054 were significant and the effect of smoking became statistically significant
05 and hcw status or 1
04 had an or above 1 and smoking had an or below 1 or 0
we found no significant association between being a healthcare worker in acute hospital care and serogically confirmed influenza infection
 instead we identified household contacts in particular children and car ownership as important risk factors for scii
we did not demonstrate a strongly increased risk of influenza infection in hcws in acute hospital care
 as hcws do appear to have an increased risk for ari or  1
3 it would be plausible to expect an effect of similar order for influenza infections
 lastly prior immunity may have played a role
 another study focusing on this hypothesis is needed to investigate it further
 we found a strong dose-response relationship for child household contacts
 adult household contacts may play a role analogous but possibly less marked to that of children
 this was unexpected as car ownership was only included as a counterpart question to public transport usage
 for this reason further details on passengers frequency or duration of car use were not obtained in the study
possession of a car has not previously been recognised as a risk factor for influenza acquisition
 car users are also exposed to air pollution from other vehicles and this may predispose users to respiratory infections
 both rail and air travel have been associated with respiratory infection transmission 22 23 
vaccine uptake was relatively high both in hcws 42 and non-hcws 32
 high vaccination uptake limited the number of scii and reduced the study power
 vaccination effectiveness was 50 against scii and reached 73 for a more severe outcome scii with reported ili
only 28 of participants with scii reported an ili the majority reporting no symptoms or more minor respiratory illness
 in addition only 26 of persons with an ili had evidence of an influenza infection
 thus the ili-syndrome was a poor marker for influenza infections
 conversely respiratory symptoms due to non-infectious causes may be over-reported in non-smokers
this study was subject to a number of limitations
we explored the possibility of influenza clustering due to site-level group influences or localized influenza outbreaks
 in addition the multilevel analysis suggested that there were no significant group-level influences on the outcome
 household contacts particularly children play an important role with individuals with three or more children being at highest risk

 we aimed to compare the risk of influenza infection in healthcare workers in acute hospital care with that in non-healthcare workers over the same season
 methods we conducted a prospective multicentre cohort study during the 200607 influenza season in berlin germany
 recruited participants gave serum samples before and after the season and completed questionnaires to determine their relevant exposures and possible confounding factors
 the main outcome measure was serologically confirmed influenza infection scii defined as a fourfold or greater rise in haemagglutination inhibition antibody titres to a circulating strain of influenza with post-season titre at least 140
 weekly mobile phone text messages were used to prompt participants to report respiratory illnesses during the influenza season
 a logistic regression model was used to assess the influence of potential risk factors

our results suggest that healthcare workers in hospitals do not have a higher risk of influenza than non-healthcare workers although their risk of any respiratory infection is slightly raised
 household contacts seem to be more important than exposure to patients
 car ownership is a surprise finding which needs further exploration
 asymptomatic infections are common accounting for around a third of serologically confirmed infections
 the german standing commission for immunisation along with other authorities 1 2 3 currently recommends that healthcare workers hcws be vaccinated against seasonal influenza
 two reasons are cited firstly that hcws can be a source of infection for vulnerable people under their care 1 2 3  and secondly that hcws are at increased risk for contracting influenza 1 
 vaccination of hcws should theoretically reduce the risk of influenza infection both in themselves and their patients
 there is evidence to support the first reason for vaccination the protection of patients
 hcws can transmit influenza to those under their care during both outbreaks and non-outbreak situations 4 5 6 7 
 low vaccination rates in hcws have been associated with nosocomial outbreaks 4 8  and higher vaccination rates with reduced nosocomial influenza incidences 7 
hcws may transmit influenza to those under their care but is there evidence that their occupational exposures to patients relatives colleagues and the hospital environment confer an increased risk of influenza compared to the general population influenza serological attack rates in hcws of 23 single season 9  and 14 an average of two seasons 10  have been documented
 however as serological attack rates of influenza may vary considerably from season to season as well as from location to location without the inclusion of a comparison group of non-hcws neither study could demonstrate an increased risk
another aspect of influenza in hcws is that many hcws argue that they withdraw from work when they become ill with influenza-like illness to reduce their risk of transmitting influenza to their patients
 however not all serologically diagnosed influenza infections experience an influenza-like illness and a proportion will be asymptomatic
 the frequency of asymptomatic influenza infection in hcws has been assessed in volunteer studies 33 11  a cohort study 28 9  and one randomised controlled study 42 10 
the objective of this study was to address the question of whether hcws in the acute care hospital setting have a higher risk of serologically confirmed influenza infections scii than non-hcws and to assess the proportion of individuals with scii who experience either any respiratory symptoms or an influenza-like illness
we conducted our study in people living or working in berlin during the influenza season of 200607 using a multicentre prospective cohort design
there were 11 study sites three hospitals two administrative centres the robert koch institute and vivantes healthcare administrative centre four blood-donation centres and two colleges
 hcws and some non-hcws were sought from the hospitals but only non-hcws were sought from all other sites
we recruited participants through occupational health services in the hospitals and one administrative centre through direct recruitment at blood donation centres and through active recruitment during site visits at the other study sites non-healthcare workers from one administrative centre and two colleges
on recruitment before the influenza season consenting participants gave a single serum sample and completed an exposure questionnaire
 details recorded included age sex type of employment risk factors for influenza smoking status and vaccination status
 where participants had been vaccinated fewer than 14 days before the sample was taken or were found to have been vaccinated shortly after the initial sample was taken a second sample taken at least 14 days after vaccination was sought through direct recall or through occupational health
blood samples were refrigerated then transported within three days to the national reference laboratory for influenza at the robert koch institute in berlin where they were centrifuged and frozen
hcw in our context were defined as people working on a daily basis with unwell patients in an acute hospital setting including nurses trainee and qualified and doctors
 non-hcw were those working or studying at the study sites or attending the blood donation centres who did not fit the definition of hcw
exclusions applied to both hcws and non-hcws were people with patient contact in the community such as community doctors and nurses dentists and pharmacists people working in care homes laboratory workers who had contact with respiratory samples or with influenza virus people who planned to be away from berlin for more than two weeks during the projected season january to april and people who did not wish to be contacted weekly by mobile phone short message system sms or email
for the analysis of serologically-confirmed infections we excluded vaccinated individuals where the baseline serum sample was taken fewer than 14 days after vaccination or where a later second sample was not obtainable see recruitment above
 these participants were excluded from the serological analyses as any titre rise could have been caused by vaccination and not infection
because pigs can carry influenza viruses and participants with pig contact were associated with scii participants reporting contact with pigs were excluded
in order to document weekly occurrences of respiratory infections during the influenza season we contacted all participants weekly through sms or through email asking them if they had experienced a new respiratory infection during the previous 7 days
 where participants answered yes they were contacted by telephone and details of their infection were obtained using an illness questionnaire
weekly surveillance for respiratory infections covered the period from january 13 2007 to march 30 2007 a period chosen to coincide with the influenza season
 this strategy was employed in order to maximise the predictive value of a positive answer
after the influenza season participants were recalled by sms or email
 they gave a second serum sample and completed a further questionnaire including repeat questions on vaccination status and employment type number of patient contacts on a typical day between january 13 and april 6 2007 broad age classification of patient contacts adults 17 years and children 18 years clinical specialty and usage of facemasks for hcws daily professional and household contacts use of public transport and car ownership contact with pigs for veterinary students and vaccination in previous years
 participants were asked again if they had had respiratory infections over the period january 13 2007 to 6 th april 2007 extending the period of surveillance to one week after the last weekly sms was sent
contact was defined as either touching or having a two way conversation with someone close by or for patient contact only examining or giving care to a patient
 participants were asked to estimate the number of contacts made during a typical day in household and work settings
the paired blood samples were defrosted and antibody titres were determined on the same day using the haemagglutination inhibition test to determine infection in any of the two a subtypes or the two b lineages
 we tested for antibody to the following strains titres of below 10 were assigned the value of 5 in order to allow calculation of the titre rise
 scii was defined as a fourfold or greater titre rise between preand post-season samples with a postseason titre of at least 40
 as awisconsin672005 h3n2 and a california072004 h3n2 were closely related a titre rise to either of these strains was considered as a single scii due to ah3n2
the primary outcome was evidence of scii by any of the above strains
the clinical outcomes were influenza-like-illness ili defined as an illness with an acute onset self-reported fever cough and head or body pains and acute respiratory infection ari defined as any reported infection with coryza nasal discharge or cough
 clinical outcomes were based only on completed illness questionnaires or postseason illness reports not on sms or email replies the latter being used only as the prompt for collection of illness data
where illness was reported over more than one week symptoms for each week were combined to produce a single illness episode
 to produce an epidemic curve of scii with any ili or in its absence another ari the respective dates of illness onset were plotted
 where more than one illness episode was reported we used the onset date of the episode closest to the peak on the assumption that this episode was the most likely to be due to influenza virus
we undertook bivariate analyses for all binary exposure variables and calculated risk ratios rr their 95 confidence interval and p-values
 for the comparison of the exposure groups hcw vs
 non-hcw continuous variables were analysed using the kruskal-wallis test
 for the analysis of the association with scii continuous variables were explored by grouping them in categories
 we regarded a p-value of less than 0
05 as statistically significant
 we then constructed a multivariate logistic regression model logistic command stata statacorp

the data protection protocol was approved by both state and national data protection offices in berlin and shared with all study partners
 ethical approval for the study was obtained from the university of berlin faculty of medicine charité ethics committee

 there was also no significant difference in the risk of scii between hcws and controls after stratification by vaccination status car ownership having children or regular use of public transport

 figure 3 shows the distribution of dates of onset for all scii where an episode of ari or ili was reported
the peak seen in week 9 corresponded with the peak number of positive influenza tests from berlin patients performed at the national reference laboratory for influenza from patient samples collected through the german influenza sentinel surveillance system 12 
we found no significant association between being a healthcare worker in acute hospital care and serogically confirmed influenza infection
 instead we identified household contacts in particular children and car ownership as important risk factors for scii
 30 of participants with scii reported no symptoms and only around one-quarter of those reporting influenza-like illness also had scii
we did not demonstrate a strongly increased risk of influenza infection in hcws in acute hospital care
 as hcws do appear to have an increased risk for ari or  1
3 it would be plausible to expect an effect of similar order for influenza infections
 although study limitations might have led to a failure to detect a true increase it is unlikely that we have missed a large difference in the risk of influenza
 why might hcws in hospital not have a higher risk of influenza the prevalence of infectious influenza in patients may have been low either due to the absence of influenza patients or because patients admitted later in the course of illness might have been less infectious
 also infection control measures such as use of personal protective equipment and individual or cohort isolation might have reduced the risks of infection in hcws
 lastly prior immunity may have played a role
 hcws were less likely than non-hcws to be susceptible preseason titer of less than 40 to acalifornia072004 h3n2 which was the ah3n2 strain of the previous season and related to awisconsin672005 h3n2 the dominant strain in the 200607 season
as most influenza patients admitted to hospitals are children or older people one might expect to find an increased risk for scii in hcws who work with these patient groups
 our finding of an elevated odds ratio for hcws with more frequent contact with child patients albeit not significant in this setting would be consistent with this supposition
 another study focusing on this hypothesis is needed to investigate it further
household contacts and in particular children in the home were the main significant risk factors identified in table 4 logistic regression model for persons with serologically confirmed influenza infection as outcome n  727 exposurenumber figure 3 cases of serologically confirmed influenza infection reporting acute respiratory illness ari blue and influenza-like illness ili red by date of onset of reported illness n  53
 green line on secondary y-axis smoothed line of influenza cases in berlin identified at the national reference laboratory for influenza from samples collected within the german sentinel surveillance system 12 
this study
 this finding is similar to that in another droplet-transmitted infection meningitis where household contacts constitute by far the most important risk group 13 
 we found a strong dose-response relationship for child household contacts
 the role of children as the main sources of influenza transmission has been suggested in several studies 14 15 16 17 
 adult household contacts may play a role analogous but possibly less marked to that of children
 whilst public transport usage was not associated with scii car ownership was a significant risk factor albeit only in households without children
 this was unexpected as car ownership was only included as a counterpart question to public transport usage
 for this reason further details on passengers frequency or duration of car use were not obtained in the study
possession of a car has not previously been recognised as a risk factor for influenza acquisition
 however sharing a car does involve prolonged close contact in an enclosed space and has been linked to transmission of one airborne pathogen 18 
 in one observational study on risk factors for sars in china using a taxi more than once a week was identified as independent risk factor for sars infection with an increased odds ratio close to significance p  0
07
 furthermore this variable was kept in the multivariate model while riding a bus and taking the subway who were significant in bivariate analysis were not 19 
 ownership of a car may also be a marker for having a greater number of social contacts perhaps including children
 car users are also exposed to air pollution from other vehicles and this may predispose users to respiratory infections
 despite the unexpected nature of this finding it is possible that car usage is indeed a risk factor and should be explored through further studies
we did not find an increased risk of influenza in the 58 of participants who were regular users of public transport
 public transport usage has been cited as a possible risk factor for influenza infection particularly in the context of pandemic planning 20 
 in a recent international survey of precautionary behaviour for pandemic influenza 75 of respondents said that they would avoid public transport 21 
 both rail and air travel have been associated with respiratory infection transmission 22 23 
 whilst it is possible to contract influenza on public transport our results suggest that at least in berlin using public transport does not increase a persons risk of influenza
 in berlin crowding on public transport is infrequent and not extreme so this result may not be generalisable to cities with different conditions
vaccine uptake was relatively high both in hcws 42 and non-hcws 32
 reasons for this high hcw uptake include the participation of a hospital from former east germany where vaccination uptake in hospitals is still found to be higher than in west german hospitals
 in non-hcws the participation of a federal public health institute where influenza vaccination is freely offered to employees may account for the high vaccination rate
 high vaccination uptake limited the number of scii and reduced the study power
 vaccination effectiveness was 50 against scii and reached 73 for a more severe outcome scii with reported ili
only 28 of participants with scii reported an ili the majority reporting no symptoms or more minor respiratory illness
 the proportion of asymptomatic infections 30 or more was substantial and similar to that reported by elder 28 9 and consistent with an estimated proportion of 33 obtained from pooled challenge studies 10 
 in addition only 26 of persons with an ili had evidence of an influenza infection
 thus the ili-syndrome was a poor marker for influenza infections
 unvaccinated hcws who intend to withdraw from work when they become ill with influenza-typical symptoms may overlook many symptomatic or asymptomatic influenza infections putting patients at unnecessary risk
the association of hcw status and ari may reflect the fact that hcws communicate with or care for a large number of people including patients colleagues and relatives and are thus exposed to a wide variety of respiratory pathogens
 the reduced risk for ari in people aged over 50 years might be explained by their cumulative immune experience or a lower contact rate
 the apparent protective effect of smoking could be due to lower ascertainment of ari in this group where a background of smoking-related symptoms may have masked the onset of an additional mild infectious respiratory illness
 conversely respiratory symptoms due to non-infectious causes may be over-reported in non-smokers
what significance does this study have for the current h1n1v pandemic as pandemic influenza should result in a higher attack rate than seasonal influenza the prevalence of influenza in hospital inpatients and staff is likely to be higher than for seasonal influenza so increasing the risk of exposure and infection for hcws compared to that described here
 for the same reasons the risk in hcws and non-hcws from their household contacts would also be higher than for seasonal influenza
 therefore even if a repeat study during pandemic conditions identified a significant occupational risk for hcws household exposures might still be more strongly associated with influenza infection
this study was subject to a number of limitations
 as recruiting at the hospital and one administrative study site was done through the occupational health departments only a small proportion fewer than 10 of the hcws at these sites were enrolled in the study
 selection bias could have concealed any actual relationship between hcws status and influenza infection if hcws with a lower risk of influenza than their non-recruited colleagues were to have enrolled or if non-hcws with a higher risk of influenza enrolled
 it is possible that hcws with a higher number of patient contacts and therefore in theory a higher risk of influenza would be less likely to participate due to pressure of work
 alternatively hcws who were concerned about their higher risk of influenza may have protected themselves better and may have been more likely than other hcws to participate which would tend to decrease the relative risk in this group
loss of recruited participants mostly due to losses to follow up despite repeated attempts to contact and to the timing of vaccination reduced the effective power of the study and may have worsened selection bias although excluded participants did not differ significantly with respect to variables found to influence the outcome
although there were differences between the two comparison groups with respect to sex recent immunisation smoking and use of public transport the logistic regression methods should have adjusted for these where they had an effect on the outcome in particular immunisation
 the lower average age and higher proportion of females in the hcw group is likely to be due to recruitment among trainee nurses in the larger hospitals
serological testing for influenza infection alone rather than molecular testing methods may have underestimated the true number of influenza infections 24 
 this along with the relatively high vaccination uptake will have reduced the number of scii and thus the effective study power
 with an attack rate of 10 in non-healthcare workers the sample size of 736 analysed would not have been sufficient to detect a relative risk below 1
8 80 power 5 significance
we explored the possibility of influenza clustering due to site-level group influences or localized influenza outbreaks
 analysis of symptom onset dates revealed no evidence of separate site-specific outbreaks but instead the epidemic curves at each study site followed the overall trend
 in addition the multilevel analysis suggested that there were no significant group-level influences on the outcome
our study results suggest that hcws in an acute hospital care setting are at no higher risk of influenza than the general public or that if they are the increased risk is modest
 household contacts particularly children play an important role with individuals with three or more children being at highest risk
 use of public transport does not increase the risk of influenza whereas in the absence of household children car ownership does seem to significantly increase the risk for influenza infection although the mechanism is unclear
 further research would help to clarify the role of household contacts of different age groups the relevance of car ownership and whether subgroups of hospital hcwsor hcws in other settings such as in primary careare at increased risk for influenza infection
 finally the ili-syndrome is a poor marker for influenza infection suggesting that hcws cannot rely on this syndrome if they wish to confidently protect their patients but should instead be vaccinated
 
 one such debate is whether risk is socially constructed
 the rationalist approach puts emphasis on scientific management statistics and decision theory in order to control risk
 the proximity of residential areas to hazardous industrial ones has become increasingly important due to urban growth
 the above is a general statement attempting to express the common beliefs of the population
 the characteristics of potential dangers associated with a risk also heavily influences risk perception
 people tend to believe that rare sensational events pose a higher level of risk than more conventional events
some risk analysts regard perception as invalid because they arise from subjective influences
1 smith 2004 analyses differences between risk assessment and risk perception
 • probabilistic perception people having probabilistic perception accept that natural hazards exist and they maybe random events
 therefore they do not see any benefit in doing anything about something that is an act of god
 risks are taken more seriously if they are understood by people as life-threatening immediate and direct
 risk is also perceived to be higher if children are at risk in comparison with seniors

 these interviews were taped and anonymous

 this might not necessarily reflect a disinterest in improving job performance
 for those that wanted further educationtraining ims incident management system was the training identified most as being needed
 a number of them also proposed online courses as they are convenient
 in particular it has been suggested that they insufficiently incorporate local concerns authority culture and expertise
 community based models that encourage such interactions can often be more effective
it is not surprising that command and control was emphasized more in the response phase
 during crisis situations such approaches are far more challenging
 one of the most notable features of fig

19 hindrances to disaster and emergency management nirupama and etkin 2012 
 in general the survey respondents feel that people who survive a disaster display pro-social behaviour in the immediate aftermath
 this group felt that only solicited aid is useful as uncoordinated supplies are often a hindrance
 one noted that if relief is to be sent it should be specific to the needs of the people
to summarize emergency managers felt that priority of the institution should be to mitigate impact on people and assets
 they acknowledged that not enough time is allotted to fill gaps and consequently occasionally same mistakes are repeated
 disaster scenario simulations reveal that there are greater interdependencies than anticipated

 so if there is no singular definition of risk how can it be comprehended to begin one must become exposed to the debates that surround the controversial term
 one such debate is whether risk is socially constructed
 is it objective and measureable or subjective and immeasurable and to what degree to clarify the objective perspective is referred to as the rationalist approach and the subjective perspective is referred to as the constructionist approach etkin 2016
 the rationalist approach puts emphasis on scientific management statistics and decision theory in order to control risk
 the constructionist approach suggests that nothing is a risk in itself but rather that it is a product of cultural political social and historical ways of seeing
 the above-mentioned debate is one of major standing in the field of risk however risk does in fact reflect upon both perspectives
 if risk is socially constructed society has made decisions which have inadvertently determined who is at risk and what the risks are
 there are several factors contributing to socially constructed risk such as minorities education disability elderly and children poverty and health pine 2009 
 a well-developed example of a socially constructed risk faced by many in urbanized areas has been provided by etkin 2016 in the quoteallowing housing construction near hazardous chemical plants is a socialpolitical decision that puts people who live there in harms way
 the proximity of residential areas to hazardous industrial ones has become increasingly important due to urban growth
when a person is exposed to a risk they do not respond to that risk directly rather they respond to their own perception of that risk
 generally speaking the average person non-expert relies on intuition to assess a risk this concept is referred to as risk perception
 within social groups acting powers downplay certain risks and emphasize others as a means of maintaining and controlling the group slovic 1987 
 a common perception found within many industrialized nations is the belief that people are presently exposed to a higher degree of risk than traditionally faced in the past and risks to be faced in the future will be larger than present risk schneider et al
 2006 etkin and haque 2003 
 the above is a general statement attempting to express the common beliefs of the population
 there is however two viewpoints of risk not mentioned in the above-mentioned common perception lay judgment of risk and expert judgement of risk
 lay judgement is generally a rights-based approach that focuses on justice uncertainty who benefits from the risk who is at risk and dread
 it is important to note that expert judgement is prone to the same biases as laypeople especially if the experts are forced to go beyond the limits of available data and rely on intuition slovic 1987 
 with that being said members of the public sometimes do not possess all of the information relating to a certain hazard and therefore can be misinformed
 it is beneficial to embrace both the public and expert viewpoints in order to develop a well-rounded grasp on risk as both views offer unique intelligence and insight in hébert 2016 
research suggests that one of the greatest influences on risk perception is cultural factors causing a distortion of perception that can travel between social groups potentially distorting the actualrealistic threats
 risk perception is fueled by peoples experiences or lack-of emotions and social and cultural factors of the community along with numerous influencers
 each individual experiences and perceives risk differently and therefore makes it difficult to truly define the concept gierlach et al
 2010 isdr 2004 gtz 2004 
 risk perception is influenced by direct or indirect experiences of activities events andor technologies for example receiving information from news sources or witnessing a natural disaster such as a severe flood
 the characteristics of potential dangers associated with a risk also heavily influences risk perception
 people tend to believe that rare sensational events pose a higher level of risk than more conventional events
 peoples judgements of risk stem from social learning peer influences and cultural practices and are continuously exposed to media reports and other processes of communication
 similar to risk risk perception is viewed differently by each individual depending on the following factors the type of risk the context of the risk the social context and the individuals personality
 an individuals perception of risk is a motivator urging community members to spring in to action mitigate avoid and adapt to risks wachinger et al
 2013 
some risk analysts regard perception as invalid because they arise from subjective influences
 but to the general public perception are the only relevant views because they incorporate the experts analysis together with individual judgement based on individual experience social context and other factors
 the public also suspects that limits exist to what experts know a suspicion that is justified in certain cases sjöberg 2001 
 table 5 
1 smith 2004 analyses differences between risk assessment and risk perception
lay people perceive hazards differently from technical experts for a variety of reasons including geographical location and aspects of their personality
 for example rural dwellers often perceive flood hazard perception closer to objectively derived estimates than urban dwellers smith 2004 nirupama and simonovic 2007 nirupama et al
 2014 
 group perceptions can easily be influenced by social or cultural factors as the influence of personality is exercised mainly through the so-called locus of control
 this classifies people according to the extent that they believe hazardous events are dependent on fate external control or within their own responsibility internal control
 in order to reduce the stress associated with uncertainty hazard perceivers tend to adopt certain recognizable models of risk perception with which they are more comfortable
 these can be grouped into three basic types all of which conflict with more objective risk analysis smith 2004 • determinate perception people having determinate perception believe that extreme events such as earthquakes and flash flooding do exist but they occur in a certain pattern
 • dissonant perception people having dissonant perception believe that natural hazards are freak events that are unlikely to be repeated
 • probabilistic perception people having probabilistic perception accept that natural hazards exist and they maybe random events
 therefore they do not see any benefit in doing anything about something that is an act of god
 if decision makers responsible for disaster mitigation happen to hold probabilistic perception they may not support investing of resources in mitigation measures
social amplification of risk occurs when relatively minor threats elicit a disproportionately strong degree of public concern as demonstrated in table 5
 2 kasperson et al
 1988 
 risks are taken more seriously if they are understood by people as life-threatening immediate and direct
 this means that an earthquake a rapid onset event is normally rated more seriously than a drought a slow onset hazard
 risk is also perceived to be higher if children are at risk in comparison with seniors
 additionally lack of understanding of complex technologies associated with factories and chemical industries in the vicinity leads to fear and distrust in technical experts and the authorities
 currently ongoing environmental and climate adapted from whyte and burton 1982  smith 2004 change concerns are perceived differently by younger generation than older people whose priorities tend to be around health and safety issues fischer et al
 1991 
 awareness is heightened when public health is at stake
 for example the city of flint michigan is facing in the worst public health crisis seen to date in the united states
 with flints struggling economy in 2014 the local government officials made a decision to switch the water from being supplied by lake huron and pre-treated in detroit to be supplied by the flint river without adding in the anticorrosive agent in order to save the city money
 the decision to not add in the anticorrosive agent would cascade in to a major health disaster as entire region was exposed to lead poisoning as well as exposure to legionella bacteria for 18 months
 the health effects this water crisis caused flint was unimaginable to the community
 the people were unaware that there was lead in the water that could be absorbed through the skin as well as being ingested flint task force 2016
 the community was starting to see the side effects of the water in forms of rashes eye irritations and behavioural changes gupta et al

 people are also extremely fearful of nuclear accidents and nuclear power plants and have a great deal of skepticism in the industry
 the world has seen accidents such as the three miles island in 1979 chernobyl in 1986 and recently fukushima meltdown in japan in 2011
 the three mile island unit 2 tmi-2 reactor near middletown pennsylvania usa partially melted down on march 28 1979

 considerable damage was caused to buildings and infrastructure particularly along japans north-eastern coast
 the tsunami caused meltdown of the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant due to the loss of the cooling function at the operating reactor units2 as well as at the spent fuel pools
 despite the efforts of the operators at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant to maintain control the reactor cores in units 1-3 overheated the nuclear fuel melted and the three containment vessels were breached
 hydrogen was released from the reactor pressure vessels leading to explosions inside the reactor buildings in units 1 3 and 4 that damaged structures and equipment and injured personnel
 radionuclides were released from the plant to the atmosphere and were deposited on land and on the ocean
 there were also direct releases into the sea
 people within a radius of 20 km of the site and in other designated areas were evacuated and those within a radius of 20-30 km were instructed to shelter before later being advised to voluntarily evacuate
 restrictions were placed on the distribution and consumption of food and the consumption of drinking water

the media has a fascination with disastrous events influencing and inflating public anxiety and perceptions of danger borum et al
 2010 
 when events such as school or college shootings occur public fear is heightened due to the fact that schools are portrayed as a safe place for children lindle 2008 
 like the general public teachers hear about school shootings occurring exacerbating their existing fear of violence against children
 similarly wildforest fires that have potential to engulf communities and explosions caused by various reasons with a potential to hurt communities receive much and prolonged attention by the media
 people are generally fearful of fires due to their destructive nature and stomach turning reaction to burn injuries or death
 they provoke extreme passion in peoples minds
 there are also advantages to media attention in that it creates awareness emotional engagement and encourages donations and other forms of help by local national and international community
 a recent example of a forest fire is fort mcmurray alberta fires in may 2016

be vulnerability is degree of loss from 0 to 100 resulting from a potential damaging phenomenon
 the public safety canada psc 2012 describes vulnerability as a condition or set of conditions determined by physical social economic and environmental factors or processes that increases the susceptibility of a community to the impact of hazards
also defined in the psc 2012 report is the vulnerability assessment as the process of identifying and evaluating vulnerabilities describing all protective measures in place to reduce them and estimating the likelihood of consequences

 many times vulnerable people living in hazard-prone areas do not perceive their exposure to risk concerning enough to becoming their top priority nirupama 2015 as basic necessities of life remains their main focus
 perception about peoples behaviour during emergencies defines to a large extent how authorities would plan resource allocation for community emergency response as well as develop and implement mitigation measures
 during the past decade a paradigm shift in the approach to disaster management has been apparent and community participation is being encouraged by policy makers
 it is believed that community participation not a top-down approach will bring about a comprehensive and accurate appreciation of peoples perception regarding hazard risk vulnerability and resilience
 experts wisner et al
 2004 ferrier and haque 2003 twigg 2007 unisdr 2001 have also delved in explaining the progression of peoples vulnerability by employing various arguments given the social physical and political environments
 birkmann 2006 has developed indicators for identifying and assessing vulnerability

 for example living near a railway track can be associated with potential risks such as train derailment harmful emissions toxic spills fires and explosions
 this was the case in 2015 when a small engine fire from a train left oil and debris on various properties in mississauga in the gta presenting a health risk to residents city news 2015
 a program with policies and procedures designed to consider cultures and community needs will not only benefit the community tremendously but also allow for knowledge-based and well understood perceptions of people
 another major accident occurred in july 2013 when a train carrying inflammable petroleum crude oil derailed and exploded in the downtown area of in lac-mégantic quebec

 the tragedy triggered a feeling of deep grief and sorrow in the close knit community and a movement to move the rail track away from the town
 media reported conversations with impacted people in which they openly expressed their lack of trust with the authorities including the transport safety board of canada and the government of canada in terms of how risks are being managed
 people also perceived the situation as a case of companies putting their interest and convenience ahead of the safety of people and the environment and impact on communitiesboth emotional and physical
in toronto canada though the exponentiallyincreasing number of immigrants from around the world is a positive sign new challenges arise from the standpoint of emergency management institutional culture and practices
 proper governance is vital to creating an environment that would help new immigrants integrate in the society
 according to the 2006 census statistics canada 2008 toronto is one of the only four census divisions where more than 16 new immigrants 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 fall in the low income category -5 higher than the national average
 ontario is the largest population centre ten of the top twenty-five most populous canadian municipalities are in ontario toronto being number one at more than 2
5 million
 ontario is home to more than half of canadas visible minorities out of which more than 30 reside in the gta while the national average is only 16

 though two-thirds of torontos adult population has completed postsecondary education the percentage of allophones persons whose first language is neither english nor french is as high as 86 in several prominent municipalities
 employment numbers are discouraging and newer dwellings are built further away from places of workan additional contributing factor in the progression of vulnerability
 in this scenario it is prudent to pay attention to how vulnerabilities are perceived by policy makers with regards to emergency management and how they might impact potential disasters mileti 1999 mitchell 2003 tierney 2007 
 two studies are discussed in this section to illustrate the role and importance of peoples perception of risk and vulnerability
 the first study nirupama and maula 2013 is based on a focus group session conducted at the south asian womens centre sawc in toronto canada fig

 the participant women in the group were regular members of the centre using the resource because they were vulnerable in more than one way

the second study was carried out in the region of peel in the gta fig

 the region of peel has a regional emergency management rem program in place
 a survey conducted by the rem highlighted that among immigrants and visible minorities presence of fire safety devices and other precautionary measures are less common and there is a lack of social support for emergency situations
 this research is based on the premise set by the rem survey to further explore peoples knowledge preferences interests priorities and perceptions in order to identify strengths and weaknesses in the society
 a questionnaire based survey was used to collect data from three different community locations in the city of brampton namely south fletchers sportsplex 
 the questionnaire consisted of 29 questions intended to gather information from a sample of entities for the purpose of constructing attributes of the larger population of which the entities are members

it is apparent from the responses in the two case studies that to a certain degree people understand the importance of social network but they do not see a need to there is also a lack of awareness and understanding in regards with what is meant by potential risk as a number of responses were other not applicable or no response
 peoples perception on issues concerning assessment of their vulnerability in the context of their society must be observed after disseminating sufficient knowledge in addition to making efforts to attract their attention to the importance of such issues
 particularly with an emphasis on how cultural myths and false beliefs affect decision-making various authors have discussed barriers to good disaster management e
g
 der heide 1989 alexander 2002
 these include post-disaster recreation of vulnerability removal of natural protective barriers failure to learn from the mistakes of others failure to correct existing but known deficiencies overdependence upon technology lack of recognition of system problems the inter-governmental paradox institutional ambiguities apathy underestimation of risk overestimation of capacity lack of resources cultural attitudes such as fatalism defeatism etc
 social pressures opposing special interest groups and reliance upon mythsfalse beliefs in disaster planning response and management
 research in the nascent field of disaster management suggests that it is often ineffective because of a large number of reasons
 how the professional emergency management community perceives barriers that hinder effective emergency management and views itself may provide useful insights and suggest strategies that might be used to help develop a culture of safety nirupama and etkin 2009 
the way many disasters unfold can be attributed in part to a lack of institutional preparedness and a general perception of risk whyte and burton 1982 slovic 2000 white et al
 2001 alexander 2002 twigg 2007 olanubi 2009 
 to better understand this issue nirupama and etkin 2012 conducted a study to obtain insights into the minds and thoughts of emergency management professionals in ontario canada
 in order to assess how emergency management institutions perceive their importance in terms of canadian society and the emergency management community the authors interviewed a number of experts positioned in policy-making and decision-making capacities
 based on these interviews a questionnaire was prepared that highlighted some major concerns such as disaster mythsfalse beliefs institutional barriers knowledge limitations cultural barriers and resource limitations
 in total nine experts three per sector in emergency management were interviewed from a the public b the private and c non-profit sectors in order to ascertain their opinions and perspectives on cultural and other barriers to risk reduction
 specific agencies targeted include a emergency management ontario public safety canada and health canada b bank of montreal ibm and ontario hydro and c red cross salvation army and canadian centre for emergency preparedness
 the interviews were semi-structured with open-ended questions to elicit rich details on the barriers to emergency management in canada
 further the open-ended format minimized the influence of researchers biases on the issue
 these interviews were taped and anonymous
 post interview analysis highlighted the attitudes and perceptions of the interviewees with respect to themselves their own organizations their role in emergency management in canada and their clients
the questionnaire that was prepared based on these expert interviews was employed to conduct an anonymous survey of approximately 70 emergency managers in ontario with the assistance of the ontario association of emergency managers which is the provincial professional organization for emergency managers
 twenty-four or 34 of the surveyed people replied
generally speaking respondents scored emergency management institutions as having an average performance with the exception of their own which they tended to rate as significantly higher than others
 most of them asserted that the amount of education and training they had received in their field was good or very good
 this might not necessarily reflect a disinterest in improving job performance
 the half of the respondents that were undecided might hesitate due to other concerns such as being at the twilight of their career potential costs or the difficulty of balancing further education with career and family
 one respondent felt that it is better to use proven procedures and techniques rather than pursuing new creative ways of doing things
 for those that wanted further educationtraining ims incident management system was the training identified most as being needed
 on deciding whether or not to take further education or training two-thirds of the respondents said they would prefer short courses
 a number of them also proposed online courses as they are convenient
emergency managers views were sought regarding whether a command  control hierarchical model would be preferred over a community-based one fig
 5
18 
 the question was in the context of the four phases of the emergency management cycle namely mitigation and prevention preparedness response and recovery
 this question was placed within the following context two different models of emergency and disaster management are a one that is top down command  control and b another that is community based
 hierarchical command and control models based upon a pyramidal authority structure have been criticized as not being the most effective for handling complex disasters
 in particular it has been suggested that they insufficiently incorporate local concerns authority culture and expertise
 community based models that encourage such interactions can often be more effective
 from an alternate perspective president bush after hurricane katrina said it is now clear that a challenge on this scale requires greater federal authority and a broader role for the armed forces
 
 
it is not surprising that command and control was emphasized more in the response phase
 it is much easier to implement community based approaches during normal day-to-day non-emergency operations where there are few time constraints and decisions are not urgent
 during crisis situations such approaches are far more challenging
 what is surprising is that so many preferred a command and control approach during the mitigation and prevention phases in the personal experience of the authors emergency managers often prefer community engagement in this part of the cycle
 one of the most notable features of fig
 5 
18 is a large variance in terms of how the respondents viewed command-and-control versus community-based approaches
 recent academic literature has emphasized problems with top-down management structures and emphasized the importance of including community involvement e
g
 mileti 1999 canton 2007 
 in part this may reflect a tendency for emergency managers to come from military or first responder backgrounds where this approach works well and is the basis for much of their training and work
information sharing came up as an important component of em as can be seen in the select four quotes from the comments section of the survey as given belowhow can you expect members of the community to become involved if they arent aware of the risks they faceagencies and jurisdictions are dependent upon one another and all elements of the community are dependent upon a number of critical infrastructure sectorsorganizations
 time and again at tabletop exercises participants discover that there are greater interdependencies nirupama and etkin 2012 than they had previously anticipated
 more robust and systemic information sharing would minimize this kind of surprise and often these moments of oh we didnt know that are the most useful outcomes of multi-party and multi-sector exercises
emergency events dont respect geographical boundariesneither planning nor response should be done in a vacuum
public has a right to know and to be informed
 public is responsible for themselves and must educate and prepare accordingly
 i believe is promotes resiliency
on the contrary few but striking arguments were presented against information sharingrestricting the information received on a communitys vulnerabilities would be in our best interest
encouraging information sharing can be a difficult proposition to sell because i have noticed that the general perception is that sharing the results of a hira would point out where all the vulnerabilities are
 that is true to an extent but that neglects the unknown vulnerabilities that arise from not knowing how our partner agencies jurisdictions and critical sectors rely on us and on one another
 the general thinking is still that each agency and jurisdiction looks out for itself particularly at the senior management levels in my opinion and there is little focus on the overall coordinated em and disaster response effort
 there is information sharing to be sure often at multi-party exercises
 it is just that i think there needs to be more and it needs to be integrated into our processes and the way we think about the how and why of information sharing
 figure 5 
19 illustrates the responses concerning possible hindrances to effective and efficient emergency and disaster management
 even though 79 of the responses blame insufficient funds some noted that effective programs and policies are also necessary that would make emergency management a greater part of canadian culture
 a large number 75 also thought political factors are a major barrier to emergency and disaster management
 many felt that there is a lot of politicking when it comes to emergency management thus action is not taken until forced the 2003 sars crisis was given as an example
 by politicking we refer to the need to engage in the political process to obtain resources conflicts between fig

19 hindrances to disaster and emergency management nirupama and etkin 2012 
 the question was designed to seek more than one response from respondents suggesting their preference which is why the total percentage of all categories combined is more than one hundred percent various organizations and difficulties in convincing decision makers to invest in emergency management during non-emergency periods
 some expressed the opinion that politicians do not take em seriously because they do not see how it would translate into votes
while few professionals expressed concern that the institution is too bureaucratic and too slow to react others wanted to see more advertising and awareness campaigns being initiated
 regarding the federal initiative national disaster mitigation strategy it was felt that the document despite being great lacked a costbenefit analysis and support for mitigation measures and instead focussed on the costs of response and recovery
 furthermore not so optimistic comments were also found in the interviews suggesting that there is a lack of familiarity with the mitigation strategy and that governments simply legislate and make more rules without actually implementing much
based upon the set of disaster myths listed in alexander 2002 see appendix 4 for reality the following statements were made with which the practitioner was asked for their level of agreement 1 ¼ agree and 10 ¼ disagree• after a disaster survivors tend to be dazed and apathetic half the respondents did not disagree with the claim that disaster survivors are dazed and apathetic though some noted that it depends on the type of disaster
 • looting is a common and serious problem after disasters 46 agree that looting is a common problem after disasters
 • disasters give rise to spontaneous displays of antisocial behavior fifty eight percent disagree with the assumption that disasters give rise to spontaneous displays of antisocial behaviour
 in general the survey respondents feel that people who survive a disaster display pro-social behaviour in the immediate aftermath
 • any kind of aid and relief is useful after disaster provided that it is supplied quickly enough fifty four percent of the respondents said that not all aid or relief is useful after a disaster
 this group felt that only solicited aid is useful as uncoordinated supplies are often a hindrance
 one noted that if relief is to be sent it should be specific to the needs of the people
 another good point was that if the aid required a substantial amount of resources to manage it would be more of a hindrance than a help as em teams might be put to better use the resources elsewhere
 • people will flee in large numbers from a disaster thirty four percent of respondents were confident that people tend to flee
the responses on disaster myths suggest a positive bias since a large proportion of the emergency managers subscribed to common disaster myths
 this is a well known phenomenonwhere people tend to view themselves and the world in a considerably more positive light than is objectively justified bazerman and watkins 2004 
 this result is similar to the findings of fischer 1998 who found that the frequency of belief in myths by emergency managers was independent of years in the job or experience but only depended upon level of education
to summarize emergency managers felt that priority of the institution should be to mitigate impact on people and assets
 they acknowledged that not enough time is allotted to fill gaps and consequently occasionally same mistakes are repeated
 disaster scenario simulations reveal that there are greater interdependencies than anticipated
 the role of hazard identification and risk assessment at the provincial level was felt vital
 it was recognized that risk and vulnerability assessment and prioritization is pivotal for making connections with disaster mitigation strategies and resource allocation
 in accordance with what etkin 1999 presented regarding risk transference and related trends we notice that the process of risk assessment lies more within the jurisdiction of municipalities and cities than at higher levels of government
identify three recent disaster events and analyze them from different perception point of view -i how impacted people reacted to the events ii what you think of the extent of vulnerability in the impact regions iii how first responders and the authorities perceived the events

the inescapable political character of social constructs thus reflects strong global centrifugal forces urging a transformational change
000525b51f78000644865b63d47ac27c624c5981   today the term pandemic is both a metaphor for a global process and a specific instance of that process
 the process in question is a distorted form of development whose expression in neoliberalism has produced in pandemic fashion colossal but highly concentrated wealth enormous inequality and vast environmental destruction with profound implications for the construction of risk to natural and anthropogenic hazards globally dickinson and burton 2015 
 the specific instance is the covid-19 pandemic a global disaster the scale of which transcends ecological regions national borders economies and societies overwhelming their specific capacities to address disruption of societal functions
 the current toll in total cases exceeds 28 million cases 900000 deaths jhu as of this writing and could cost the global gdp up to 82 trillion over five years centre for risk studies 2020
the pandemic lays bare the interdependence complexity and inequality created by the global system linked in driving the catastrophe
 with the increasing globalization of trade and migration the intensification of linkages is also driving a globalization of biophysical phenomena that is creating problems including disasters across scales in space and in time holling 1994 
 as such in addition to its epidemiology we argue here that the covid-19 pandemic should be analyzed holistically as a disaster
although disasters traditionally were depicted as sudden unpredictable events acts of nature fate or some divine power since the 1980s disasters have come to be understood not as oneoff events but rather as socially constructed processes unfolding over time intimately related to ongoing social processes often associated with misinformed development wisner et al
 2004 
 disaster triggering events obviously differ but analogous approaches to development privileging economic growth over social and environmental values and priorities are key factors in their occurrence
 as in all disasters the pandemic represents the materialization of underlying risk conditions
 in that context disasters in general now constitute a pandemic j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f because a global population is facing a set of similar social and economic processes that coupled with systemic environmental hazards generate disasters
understanding the covid 19 pandemic as a disaster establishes relevance for policies for managing the multifaceted dimensions of risk
 this understanding requires a transdisciplinary and integrated perspective based on the proposition that the causes of any problem must be addressed in order to develop effective solutions
 such a forensic approach seeks to identify the root causes that energize the risk drivers that are ultimately expressed in conditions of vulnerability and exposure
 wisner et al 2004 burton 2010 burton  2015 oliver-smith et al
 2016  2017 
a forensic approach frames hazard exposure and vulnerability as the central components of disaster risk
 derived from long-term historical and contemporary social economic cultural political environmental and institutional processes disaster risk and disasters are directly linked to power structures and political and economic systems blaikie et al
1994 wisner et al
 2004 
 the risk associated with the pandemic has accumulated through the concatenation of a range of processes within and across territorial and governance scales
the virus is not in itself a hazard until it encounters an exposed and vulnerable population
due to the rapid exposure to the virus however and inadequate initial responses in many national contexts covid-19 poses a risk that is extensive global and transnational in character
 moreover the pandemic has characteristics of sequential and cascading risk of mortality and morbidity overwhelming stress on public health systems and widespread interruption of economic activity and social services
exposure to covid-19 is mediated through the structure of the global economic system
 the degree and nature of integration of countries and their cities into the global economy modulate flows of people and therefore of contagion primarily but not exclusively through air travel
 the populations of metropolitan cities like new york or london likely suffered greater exposure because they live in key nodes in the global economy at high density levels lavell et al
 2020 
 by virtue of their strategic importance greater connectivity was stimulated by the development of global markets
 however that connectivity is also characterized by social inequalities that skew development towards some and away from j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f others
 in addition international travel voluntary and involuntary human displacements including those of refugees migration patterns and population hubs effectively involve a notion of places as coupled in which those social interactions construct greater exposure newland 2020 
exposure is also configured by the organization of territory urban space and land use
 when people live crowded in small housing units in multi-family buildings in dense urban slums and informal settlements serviced mostly by public transport social distancing becomes next to impossible
 occupations such as service workers in general and many in informal sector activities involve close contact with the public has imposed greater risk on specific populations in a pandemic
 in the united states for example the exposure of african americans through their occupations in lower paid service jobs is underscored by fatality rates well beyond their representation in the total population apm research lab 2020
cultural and social interactional forms and patterns also may modify exposure and may also support or undermine policies such as social distancing
 governments in turn have in some cases shown themselves to be unwilling to institute strategies that run counter to specific ideological frames and local cultural norms
as is well known disaster risk is also shaped by the vulnerability of individuals and social groups
 in the covid 19 pandemic everyone is susceptible to the virus but not everyone is vulnerable in the same way or to the same degree
 some aspects of susceptibility in the pandemic are related to genetics aging and morbidity but can be exacerbated by socially constructed conditions such as malnutrition addiction and poverty which are dimensions of vulnerability rooted in processes such as corruption inequality lack of access to services such as healthcare sanitation and education due to public and private sector funding policies and development priorities
 while these factors may combine with pre-existing conditions particularly among the elderly exposure to the hazard may increase in low income nations of the south with younger populations due to poverty and related health conditions thus also increasing the pandemics impact
the massive response to covid-19 can be explained at least in its first wave because the pandemic has affected principally those nations that play powerful roles in the world economy
 it is arguable that the political and economic imperative to manage the covid-19 pandemic arises from the priorities of critical nodes in the world economy and its value chains lavell et al
 2020 
 thus far there have been two main types of risk management j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f policies
 policies have been implemented with varying degrees of success or failure primarily to address the risks of morbidity and mortality through forms of epidemiological control policies of confinement social distancing mask wearing and through strengthening public health services to avoid system collapse
 a second type of risk management policies launched by many governments and regional and multilateral organizations basically aims at ameliorating the economic impacts of the first set of strategies and include fiscal and monetary measures to mitigate the impact of health risk management actions
 deferral of tax payments partial payment of salaries and injection of liquidity into financial systems have also been used to diminish the impact of lost revenues on both the population and the economic system
 while unquestionably effective in staving off the most acute economic impacts for impacted populations the political viability of such options has placed the necessary continuation of many of these strategies in doubt as the pandemic progresses into subsequent phases
since health care is a universal human right ghebreyesus 2017  the dilemma at the most basic level is how to reconcile these two sets of policies without diminishing the effectiveness of either such as it is so far
 this tension is further complicated by the fact that morbidity and mortality are experienced locally but the economic impacts are also national and global
moreover both sets of policies obviously bring with them their own sets of risks that are experienced differently in each country and within different social groups
 the economic and social risks of prolonged confinement are likely to be much greater for informal workers migrants and homeless people amongst others who lack space to work remotely and care for children at home
 for these sectors it is possible that reducing the risk of infection from covid-19 ends up creating more risk than does ignoring recommendations for confinement to ensure income and daily sustenance
from this perspective the supposedly neutral and technocratic management of risk to lives health systems and the economy foregrounds the conflict between a health care system designed to heal and an economic system that considers monetary loss as the greater danger
hardly concealed is a transfer of risks from those social and economic sectors that will most benefit from flattening the curve and economic reactivation to those who will face more risks and receive fewer benefits
 however the huge operational dilemma between addressing the mortality and morbidity from covid-19 and the ensuing massive social and economic loss and damage from economic slowdown need to be unpacked carefully and shown to be a false j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f choice
 without a healthy producing and consuming population there will be little economic recovery
the ongoing disaster cannot be explained by a virus per se but rather as a consequence of preexisting risk conditions and management policies
 disasters generally reveal that without reducing inequality poverty and exclusion those most affected will see their risk increase von braun et al
 2020 
 the covid 19 pandemic demonstrates this point at a global level
in that context transforming the underlying risk factors is a global challenge
 there is a tension that all post disaster reconstruction efforts face between reinstalling the flawed prior system and addressing its endemic problems that created the disaster in the first place
specifically should public intervention aim to restore the same economic model that consistently prioritizes short term gain over long term human and environmental security or rather direct efforts toward transforming the model toward reducing future risk and addressing social inequalities exposed by the pandemic and other types of disaster and crisissuch a transformation means seriously addressing and eliminating current inadequacies of governance the economic system global inequities in economic social racial cultural gender and other domains protection and preservation of the global environment security displacement of populations and others
 the magnitude of addressing these root or underlying causes is enormous and the challenge of coming to grips with such endemic conditions deeply embedded and entrained in and through national and international systems is daunting to say the least
yet perhaps there is hope to be found in some of the initial responses to the emergence of the covid 19 virus and pandemic
 the pandemic has revealed that what was normal is the source of vulnerability and exposure thus requiring policies to enact the necessary transformational responses to health climate and other disaster risks now
 the early stages of the pandemic also showed that financial resources can be made available at a level thought impossible as little as six months ago
 it has also revealed that a significant political will normally conspicuously absent in dealing with other global issues can be mobilized to address a global crisis
 and it has shown that strong and effective measures to reduce contagion risk can be made where social institutions and political structures are competent well organized and supported
 the longer term durability of such measures however is absolutely essential for success in combatting the virus
 while the epidemiological perspective is obviously essential framing the pandemic as a disaster alerts us to the significance of the causal chain of root causes and risk drivers and their interactions with existing or novel hazards both across and within territorial and governance scales
the inescapable political character of social constructs thus reflects strong global centrifugal forces urging a transformational change
 an integrated comprehension of the global and the local as different but complementary spheres of action in which phenomena such as climate change rosenbloom and markard 2020 and the covid-19 pandemic are framed as socially constructed risks is essential to move to a new and different normal transforming the way the global geopolitics and economics are constructed
 unquestionably the pandemic will change the world perhaps for the better if it leads to policies that address the underlying risk drivers or for worse if it furthers greater authoritarianism suppression of individual guarantees and rights exacerbation of inequality and protection of entrenched economic and financial interests over and above human security
 in effect the pandemic has both demonstrated a dire need and opened a window of opportunity to move both national and global systems toward more just and equitable conditions
 
 the current covid-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2
 to date there are no vaccines or specific antiviral drugs to prevent or treat covid-19
 hence it is necessary to accelerate the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines to help mitigate this pandemic
 non-conventional antiviral agents must also be considered and exploited
 in this regard nanoparticles can be used as antiviral agents for the treatment of various viral infections
 these nanomaterials include silver gold quantum dots organic nanoparticles liposomes dendrimers and polymers
 further we consider antiviral mechanisms the effects of nanoparticles on coronaviruses and therapeutic approaches of nanoparticles
 finally we provide our perspective on the future of nanoparticles in the fight against viral infections
 infectious diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms that spread directly or indirectly from one person to another 1 
 fortunately only a handful of these diseases are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality 2 3 
 among them human immunodeficiency virusacquired immune deficiency syndrome hivaids tuberculosis and malaria are the most pronounced
 2020 stated that researchers need to focus on the development of nanomaterial-based technological solutions to fight covid-19 56 
 further we discuss antiviral mechanisms therapeutic approaches of nanoparticles and the effects of nanoparticles on covs
 finally we provide our perspective on the potential of using nanoparticles in the future to treat infectious diseases
virus entry into host cells is required for viral multiplication
 the infection process involves several steps including attachment penetration uncoating replication assembly and release  figure 1 
 the specificity of the interaction determines the kind of virus that infects the host cells
 for example bacteriophages enter the host cell through their nucleic acids and the capsid remains outside of the cell
 some animal and plant viruses enter host cells through endocytosis
 the clinical symptoms of the above pathogen attacks are frequently fever dyspnea cough bronchiolitis and pneumonia 60 
 most respiratory tract infections are caused by sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 61 
 the released viral rna from covs is transcribed and the viral mrna directs protein synthesis
 viruses replicate and assemble into new virions and these are released into neighboring cells via exocytosis
 covid-19 is caused by the novel cov sars-cov-2 4 5 
 sars-cov-2 is 80 and 50 homologous with sars-cov and mers-cov respectively 4 62 
 synthesis of agnps is carried out by various physical chemical and biological methods
 biological methods appear to be environmentally friendly safe biocompatible and non-toxic
 agnps have been used as biomedical therapeutic agents in wound dressings long-term burn care products and anti-bacterial lotions 70 
 polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp-coated agnps homogenized in replens gel 0
 antiviral activity of agnps and chitosan composites was evaluated against h1n1 influenza a virus
 the composites showed significant antiviral activity in a size-dependent manner surprisingly chitosan alone did not show any antiviral effect
 agnps prevent transmissible gastroenteritis virus-induced apoptosis by regulating the p38mitochondria-caspase-3 signaling pathway in swine testicle cells 74 
 further agnps prevented rsv from infecting host cells by inactivating the virus directly 75 
agnps showed antiviral and preventive effects against h3n2 influenza virus infection
 graphene oxide go-agnps composed of two nanomaterials in a single platform were more effective than either single agent
 huy et al reported antiviral activity of agnps against influenza a hbv human parainfluenza hsv and hiv 78 
 agnps synthesized using a green chemistry ultra-sonication approach exhibited antiviral activity against influenza a 79 
 zanamivir-loaded agnps synergistically inhibited h1n1 influenza virus multiplication 80 
 tannic acid-modified agnp-based muco-adhesive hydrogel effectively reduced hsv-2 infectivity at the vaginal mucosal surface 81 
 children are mostly affected by rsv however there is no specific treatment option available
 agnps reduced rsv replication and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines i
 il-1α il-6 and tnf-α and pro-inflammatory chemokines i
 further the agnp-treated animals showed significantly better sera titers of anti-hsv-2 neutralization antibodies than the nacl-treated animals 83 
 agnps interaction with hiv-1 in size-dependent manner and that the bound particles exhibit regular spatial relationships
 agnps undergo preferential binding with the gp120 subunit of the viral envelope glycoprotein
 altogether all these studies demonstrated that the antiviral potential of agnps
 functionalized aunps suppress influenza virus hsv and hiv
 aunps potentially increase antiviral effects through multivalent interactions dendronized aunps inhibit hiv more effectively than dendrons alone 93 94 
 a study was performed to investigate the effect of aunps on schistosoma mansoni-infected mouse liver
 aunps conjugated with peptide triazoles aunp-pt exhibited significant antiviral effects against hiv-1 compared to the corresponding peptide triazoles alone
 nanoparticles functionalized with the flupep ligand showed enhanced antiviral activity compared to the free peptides
 conjugation of flupep to aunps and agnps enhanced antiviral potency 100 
 2018 reported that auncs prevented entry of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv into host cells 101 
 auncs selectively inhibited the proliferation and protein expression of prrsv
 therefore aunps functionalized with different molecules play critical roles in antiviral activity
 however the uses of qd as an antiviral agent are very limited
 furthermore the binding of cdte qds to the cell membrane itself also decreased viral numbers
 cdots significantly inhibited the multiplication of both prv and prrsv
 eda-cdots achieved 100 inhibition and epa cdots achieved 85-99 inhibition 107 
 the use of biomolecules to prepare cdots provides stable and biocompatible materials
 curcumin-mediated cqds cur-cqds were prepared in a one-step heating process and injected with enterovirus 71 ev71 in new-born mice
 these cur-cqds exhibited superior antiviral effects 111 
 after cdot treatment vlps remained intact and no degradation of the vlp capsid proteins was observed 107 
 collectively qds play critical roles in inhibiting various types of viruses
graphene oxide go is a unique single-atom-thick and two-dimensional carbon material arranged in a hexagonal lattice
 go is widely used as an antibacterial and anticancer agent 114

 another drug chloroquine has an immunomodulatory effect and functions at both the entry-and post-entry stages of sars-cov-2 infection 208 
 however all of these agents have undesired side effects
 therefore other agents such as nanoparticles need to be explored as alternative antiviral agents

infectious diseases cause immense global mortality and viruses are responsible for about one-third of these deaths
 respiratory infections are among the most common causes of death worldwide especially due to covs
 presently the outbreak of viral respiratory infections particularly covid-19 is widespread and continuing to spread worldwide
 therefore researchers are urgently striving to identify and develop suitable nano-based drugs and nano-vaccines in addition to conventional approaches
 nanotechnology plays a critical role in both viral disease diagnosis and therapeutics
 nanoparticles show great potential for biomedical applications especially in patients who relapse after completing conventional antiviral therapy
 further we discussed antiviral mechanisms therapeutic approaches of nanoparticles and the effects of nanoparticles on covs
 finally we provide our future perspective of nanoparticles below
 antiviral drugs currently available are effective against a few viral diseases such as influenza hepatitis hsv and hiv
 the crucial points and future focus of nano-based antiviral drugs need to be on the following important issues
 second functionalization by specific molecules is needed to facilitate effective targeting of specific sites of viral infections
 third non-or reduced-toxicity must remain a priority biocompatibility with no undesired side effects is essential
 fourth a therapeutic approach that combines nanoparticles and low concentrations of antiviral drugs with excellent efficiency is needed
0005a68bbed13ad78ca3d1be654078b8729f8975  infectious diseases account for more than 20 of global mortality and viruses are responsible for about one-third of these deaths
 highly infectious viral diseases such as severe acute respiratory sars middle east respiratory syndrome mers and coronavirus disease are emerging more frequently and their worldwide spread poses a serious threat to human health and the global economy
 the current covid-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2
 as of 27 july 2020 sars-cov-2 has infected over 16 million people and led to the death of more than 652434 individuals as on 27 july 2020 while also causing significant economic losses
 to date there are no vaccines or specific antiviral drugs to prevent or treat covid-19
 hence it is necessary to accelerate the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines to help mitigate this pandemic
 non-conventional antiviral agents must also be considered and exploited
 in this regard nanoparticles can be used as antiviral agents for the treatment of various viral infections
 the use of nanoparticles provides an interesting opportunity for the development of novel antiviral therapies with a low probability of developing drug resistance compared to conventional chemical-based antiviral therapies
 in this review we first discuss viral mechanisms of entry into host cells and then we detail the major and important types of nanomaterials that could be used as antiviral agents
 these nanomaterials include silver gold quantum dots organic nanoparticles liposomes dendrimers and polymers
 further we consider antiviral mechanisms the effects of nanoparticles on coronaviruses and therapeutic approaches of nanoparticles
 finally we provide our perspective on the future of nanoparticles in the fight against viral infections
 infectious diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms that spread directly or indirectly from one person to another 1 
 zoonotic diseases are infectious diseases of animals that can cause disease in humans when the causal agent is transmitted from animal to human the diseases can account for hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide
 infectious diseases pose a significant threat to both human health and the global economy to date we know of about 200 infectious diseases
 fortunately only a handful of these diseases are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality 2 3 
 among them human immunodeficiency virusacquired immune deficiency syndrome hivaids tuberculosis and malaria are the most pronounced
 in addition several outbreaks of infectious diseases one such alternative approach involves nanomaterials and their fascinating properties which include optimal size shape tunable surface charge superparamagnetism high surface plasmon resonance luminescence photon upconversion bioavailability biocompatibility immunocompatibilitytolerability and biodegradability

 recently sportelli et al
 2020 stated that researchers need to focus on the development of nanomaterial-based technological solutions to fight covid-19 56 
 therefore several articles are expected to provide the basic knowledge regarding nanomaterials and describe how to use these materials for the development of antiviral therapies
 considering the seriousness of infectious disease transmission and the potential of nanomaterials in treating these diseases our review first focuses on the mechanism of entry of viruses into host cells and then on the use of major and important types of nanomaterials such as silver gold quantum dots organic nanoparticles liposomes dendrimers and polymers against various types of viral infections
 further we discuss antiviral mechanisms therapeutic approaches of nanoparticles and the effects of nanoparticles on covs
 finally we provide our perspective on the potential of using nanoparticles in the future to treat infectious diseases
virus entry into host cells is required for viral multiplication
 the infection process involves several steps including attachment penetration uncoating replication assembly and release  figure 1 
 viruses enter host cells through specific receptors on the host cell membrane using attachment proteins in the viral capsid or glycoproteins embedded in the viral envelope
 the specificity of the interaction determines the kind of virus that infects the host cells
 for example bacteriophages enter the host cell through their nucleic acids and the capsid remains outside of the cell
 some animal and plant viruses enter host cells through endocytosis
 once inside the host cell rna viruses such as covs use their genomic for the synthesis of viral genomic rna as well as mrna and eventually the release of the new virions produced in the host cells 57 58 59 
 the human respiratory mucosa is the primary site of virus entry for various viruses including the influenza virus respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus
 these virulent pathogens primarily infect the upper respiratory tract but they may subsequently reach the lower respiratory regions causing more severe illness and ultimately morbidity and mortality
 the clinical symptoms of the above pathogen attacks are frequently fever dyspnea cough bronchiolitis and pneumonia 60 
 most respiratory tract infections are caused by sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 61 
 a unique feature of covs such as sars-cov-2 is their mechanism of entry into host cells initially through binding to the host-receptor cell at the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 protein site
 this is followed by fusion with the host cellular membrane and subsequent release of the viral genetic material into the host cytoplasm or nucleus
 the released viral rna from covs is transcribed and the viral mrna directs protein synthesis
 viruses replicate and assemble into new virions and these are released into neighboring cells via exocytosis
 covid-19 is caused by the novel cov sars-cov-2 4 5 
 sars-cov-2 is 80 and 50 homologous with sars-cov and mers-cov respectively 4 62

 silver nanoparticles agnps are used as antiviral antibacterial anti-inflammatory anti-angiogenesis antiplatelet antifungal and anticancer agents due to their unique physiochemical properties and superior biological functions 54 68 69 
 synthesis of agnps is carried out by various physical chemical and biological methods
 biological methods appear to be environmentally friendly safe biocompatible and non-toxic
 agnps have been used as biomedical therapeutic agents in wound dressings long-term burn care products and anti-bacterial lotions 70 
 polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp-coated agnps homogenized in replens gel 0
15 mgml inhibited hiv-1 transmission of cell-associated and cell-free hiv-1 isolates after 1 min and offered long-lasting protection of cervical tissue from infection after 48 h treatment with no evidence of cytotoxicity observed in the explants
 agnps bind to glycoprotein gp120 on the hiv envelope in a manner that prevents cd4-dependent virion binding fusion and infectivity 53 
 agnp-coated polyurethane condoms pucs efficiently inactivate hiv-1 and hsv-12 and their infectiousness macrophage m-tropic and t lymphocyte t-tropic strains of hiv-1 are highly sensitive
 the agnp-coated pucs can directly inactivate the microbes infectious ability and provide another line of defense against sexually transmitted microbial infections 71 
fungi-mediated synthesis of agnps reduced the viral infection dose in a size-dependent manner against hsv-12 and with human parainfluenza virus type 3 they blocked interaction of the virus with the cell which might depend on the size and zeta potential of the agnps 72 
 antiviral activity of agnps and chitosan composites was evaluated against h1n1 influenza a virus
 the composites showed significant antiviral activity in a size-dependent manner surprisingly chitosan alone did not show any antiviral effect
 conversely agnps alone did exhibit antiviral activity however the composites showed remarkable antiviral activity compared to either agnps or chitosan alone 73 
 agnps prevent transmissible gastroenteritis virus-induced apoptosis by regulating the p38mitochondria-caspase-3 signaling pathway in swine testicle cells 74 
 curcumin-functionalized agnps demonstrated significant inhibitory effects against respiratory syncytial virus rsv infection by decreasing viral titers about two-orders of magnitude to non-toxic concentrations in host cells
 further agnps prevented rsv from infecting host cells by inactivating the virus directly 75 
agnps showed antiviral and preventive effects against h3n2 influenza virus infection
 in the presence of agnps madin-darby canine kidney cells infected with h3n2 influenza virus showed better viability and no obvious cytopathic effects compared to an influenza virus control group
 infected mice treated with agnps showed lower lung viral titers and minor pathologic lesions in lung tissue and longevity 76 
 graphene oxide go-agnps composed of two nanomaterials in a single platform were more effective than either single agent
 go-agnps inhibited feline cov fcov infection by 25 and infectious bursal disease virus ibdv infection by 23 whereas go alone only inhibited fcov 16 and showed no antiviral activity against ibdv 77 
 huy et al reported antiviral activity of agnps against influenza a hbv human parainfluenza hsv and hiv 78 
 agnps synthesized using a green chemistry ultra-sonication approach exhibited antiviral activity against influenza a 79 
 zanamivir-loaded agnps synergistically inhibited h1n1 influenza virus multiplication 80 
 tannic acid-modified agnp-based muco-adhesive hydrogel effectively reduced hsv-2 infectivity at the vaginal mucosal surface 81 
 agnps exhibited antiviral activity against human oncogenic γ-herpesviruses kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and epstein-barr virus by reactivating viral lytic replication through the generation of reactive oxygen species ros and autophagy 82 
 children are mostly affected by rsv however there is no specific treatment option available
 the rsv virion contains two surface glycoproteins f and g that are vital for the initial phases of infection making them critical targets for rsv treatment
 agnps reduced rsv replication and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines i

 ccl2 ccl3 ccl5
 mice treated intravaginally with tannic acid ta-mediated agnps showed better clinical scores and lower virus titers in the vaginal tissues
 the ta-mediated agnp-treated group also showed significantly increased percentages of ifn-gamma cd8 t-cells activated b cells and plasma cells while the spleens contained significantly higher percentages of ifn-gamma nk cells and effector-memory cd8 t cells compared to nacl-treated group
 further the agnp-treated animals showed significantly better sera titers of anti-hsv-2 neutralization antibodies than the nacl-treated animals 83 
 agnps interaction with hiv-1 in size-dependent manner and that the bound particles exhibit regular spatial relationships
 agnps undergo preferential binding with the gp120 subunit of the viral envelope glycoprotein
 these interaction between agnps and glycoproteins inhibit the virus from binding to host cells 84 and agnps act as potential antiviral agents against various type of viruses including influenza virus 85 86 
 biologically synthesized agnps using plant extracts of lampranthus coccineus and malephora lutea exhibited significant antiviral activity against different types of viruses such as hsv-1 hav-10 and coxb4 virus 87 
 altogether all these studies demonstrated that the antiviral potential of agnps
gold nanoparticles aunps have also drawn great interest in industry and nanomedicine due to their excellent electrical optical mechanical and biological properties 88 89 
 aunps are used to detect dna sequences proteins bacteria and viruses and they are frequently used in cancer studies and as antiviral and antibacterial agents
 gold nanorod a gnr-5 ppp-ssrna nanoplex-mediated immune activator was reported to inhibit h1n1 influenza viral replication by upregulating the expression of ifn-β and other ifn-stimulated genes isgs resulting in decreased viral replication 90 
 hyaluronic acid aunps and ifn complex have been used for targeted treatment of hepatitis c hcv infection 91 and highly mono-dispersed quasi spherical aunps inhibit hsv
 compared with the clinical drug acyclovir aunps are very safe they do not induce any drug-resistant viral strains and exhibit excellent viricidal properties 92 
 functionalized aunps suppress influenza virus hsv and hiv
 aunps potentially increase antiviral effects through multivalent interactions dendronized aunps inhibit hiv more effectively than dendrons alone 93 94 
 sialic acid-functionalized aunps inhibit influenza virus infection by multivalent interactions relatively better than some synthetic clinical drugs such as zanamivir and oseltamivir which are prone to resistance development by the influenza virus 95 96 
 a study was performed to investigate the effect of aunps on schistosoma mansoni-infected mouse liver
 comparing the treated and untreated infected groups aunps significantly decreased the activities of malondialdehyde and nitric oxide and increased the level of glutathione gsh
 concomitantly aunps ameliorated the inflammatory response by decreasing the mrna expression of interleukin il-1β il-6 tumor necrosis factor tnf-α ifn-γ and inducible nitric oxide synthase 97 
 aunps also inhibited attachment and penetration of foot-and-mouth disease virus fmdv at the early stages of infection and impaired viral replication at later stages at non-toxic concentrations and at early stage 47 
 aunps conjugated with peptide triazoles aunp-pt exhibited significant antiviral effects against hiv-1 compared to the corresponding peptide triazoles alone
 the enhanced virolytic activity and corresponding irreversible hiv-1 inactivation by aunp-pt is due to multivalent contact between the nanoconjugates and metastable envelope spike s proteins on the hiv-1 virus 98 
 conjugation of m2e peptide with aunps and cpg as a soluble adjuvant aunp-m2e  scpg induced lung b cell activation and a robust serum anti-m2e immunoglobulin g igg response in mice
 antibodies generated in response to the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus h5n1 avietnam12032004 are capable of binding to the homotetrameric form of m2 expressed on infected cells 99 
 nanoparticles functionalized with the flupep ligand showed enhanced antiviral activity compared to the free peptides
 conjugation of flupep to aunps and agnps enhanced antiviral potency 100 
 gold nanoclusters auncs composed of tens and hundreds of gold atoms with an average size of 1-2 nm play critical roles in biomedicine
 bai et al
 2018 reported that auncs prevented entry of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv into host cells 101 
 auncs selectively inhibited the proliferation and protein expression of prrsv
 surface modification plays an important role in the antiviral activity of auncs therefore researchers modified the surface of auncs with two different materials-histidine and mercaptoethane sulfonate
 among these histidine-stabilized auncs showed strong inhibition of nanomaterials 2020 10 1645 8 of 29 the proliferation of pseudorabies virus prv 101 102 
 therefore aunps functionalized with different molecules play critical roles in antiviral activity
quantum dots qds are nanocrystals of a semiconducting materials with an average size between 2-10 nm and these are widely used in cell labeling detection and image tracking with particular size-dependent optical and electronic properties includes carbon silver gold cdseszns and so on 103 
 however the uses of qd as an antiviral agent are very limited
 du et al developed gsh-capped cadmium telluride cdte qds and demonstrated that they altered the structure of prv surface proteins inhibiting the virus from entering the host cells 104 
 furthermore the binding of cdte qds to the cell membrane itself also decreased viral numbers
 antiviral effects of stable carbon dots cdots with low toxicity were studied with prv and prrsv as test models of dna and rna viruses respectively
 cdots significantly inhibited the multiplication of both prv and prrsv
 furthermore cdots remarkably induced the production of endogenous ifn and the expression of isgs which are responsible for virus replication 105 106 
 the effect of various surface functionalizations of cdots was studied using 22 -ethylenedioxybisethylamine eda and 3-ethoxypropylamine epa against human norovirus virus-like-particles vlps gi
1 and gii
4
 both eda-and epa-cdots 5 µgml each were highly effective in inhibiting the binding of both strains of vlps to histo-blood group antigen hbga receptors on human cells
 eda-cdots achieved 100 inhibition and epa cdots achieved 85-99 inhibition 107 
benzoxazine monomer-derived cdots inhibited the infectivity of flaviviruses and non-enveloped viruses such as porcine parvovirus and adenovirus-associated virus by directly binding to the surface of virions and inhibiting the first step of virus and host cell interaction 108 
 cdots surface-functionalized with boronic acid or an amine inhibited the entry of hsv-1 into host cells by way of the alteration of viral coat proteins 109 
 the use of biomolecules to prepare cdots provides stable and biocompatible materials
 the antiviral effect of curcumin-stabilized cationic carbon dots ccm-cdots was evaluated against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv as a cov model ccm-cdots were found to inhibit the proliferation of pedv with much higher efficiency than non-ccm-cdots 105 
 ccm-cdots work by changing the viral surface protein structure suppressing the synthesis of virus negative-strand rna and virus budding and then inhibiting viral entry by generation of ros thus stimulating the production of isgs and proinflammatory cytokines 105 
 carbon quantum dots cqds derived from hydrothermal carbonization of ethylenediaminecitric acid inhibited the entry and replication of hcov-229e by interaction of the functional groups of the cqds with hcov-229e entry receptors on the host cell membrane 110 
 curcumin-mediated cqds cur-cqds were prepared in a one-step heating process and injected with enterovirus 71 ev71 in new-born mice
 these cur-cqds exhibited superior antiviral effects 111 
 similarly biocompatible cqds prepared using glycyrrhizic acid gly-cds inhibited the proliferation of prrsv by up to five-orders of viral titer 112 
 gly-cds inhibited prrsv invasion and replication stimulated antiviral innate immune responses and suppressed the accumulation of intracellular ros caused by prrsv infection
 surface charge of the functionalized materials play critical role in the interactions between positively charged cdots and the negatively charged vlps positively charged eda-cdots exhibited a higher inhibitory effect 82 than non-charged epa-cdots 60 107 
 both types of cdots also exhibited inhibitory effects on the binding of vlps to their respective antibodies but they were much less effective in blocking the binding to hbga receptors
 after cdot treatment vlps remained intact and no degradation of the vlp capsid proteins was observed 107 
 to summarize the observed antiviral effects of cdots on noroviruses were mainly through effective inhibition of vlp binding to hbga receptors and moderate inhibition of antibody binding without affecting the integrity of the viral capsid protein and the viral particle
 collectively qds play critical roles in inhibiting various types of viruses
graphene oxide go is a unique single-atom-thick and two-dimensional carbon material arranged in a hexagonal lattice
 go and its derivatives are of immense interest to nanomedicine researchers due to their remarkable electronic mechanical and thermal properties 113 
 go is widely used as an antibacterial and anticancer agent 114 
 go act as antiviral agent through inactivation of the pathogenic agent of hand-foot-and-mouth disease ev71 and endemic gastrointestinal avian influenza a virus h9n2 115 
 nanocomposites consisting of go and partially reduced sulfonated go rgo-so 3  composite showed antiviral activity against hsv-1 by inhibiting hsv-1 from attaching to host cells 116 
 the antiviral activity of go and reduced go was evaluated against prv a dna virus and pedv an rna virus revealing that go significantly suppressed the infection of prv and pedv by a 2-log reduction in virus titers at non-cytotoxic concentrations
 go inhibited viral entry into the host cells by structural destruction 117 
 nanocomposites consisting of go and agnps showed potential antiviral activity against enveloped and non-enveloped viruses for example fcov and ibdv respectively
 viral inhibition assays demonstrated that go-agnps inhibited fcov infection by 25 and ibdv by 23 whereas go alone only inhibited fcov infection by 16 but showed no antiviral activity against ibdv infection
 therefore the combination of go and agnps exhibited better antiviral activity compared to either go or silver alone 77 
 curcumin-loaded go exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on rsv infection with significant biocompatibility
 go inactivates directly by inhibiting the virus from attaching to host cells and considered to be coupled with prophylactic and therapeutic effects on the virus
 the combination of go and curcumin was more effective than either single agent against rsv infection 118 
 iannazzo et al
 2018 reported that the conjugation of go and qds gqds potentially inhibited the replication of hiv 119 
 hypericin hy-loaded go protected against novel duck reovirus ndrv disease which is a serious infectious disease of poultry
 the antiviral activity of the complex gohy was studied in df-1 cells and in ducklings infected with ndrv th11 strain

 zinc oxide tetrapods znots significantly block the entry of herpes simplex virus type-2 hsv-2 into target cells and also stop the spread of the virus
 the znots exhibit the antiviral activity by the ability to neutralize hsv-2 virions that natural target cells such as human vaginal epithelial and hela cells showed highly reduced infectivity when infected with hsv-2 virions 121

 zinc oxide nanoparticles zno-nps and polyethylene glycol peg-coated zno-nps with concentration of 200 µgml inhibits at the rate of approximately 92 in copy number of hsv-1 genomic dna and also it reduces virus titer 124 
 surface modified zinc oxide nanoparticles could modify the infection potential of hsv-1 via neutralizing the virus rather than through interfering with cellular targets by electrostatic interference of h-znps with virus rather than the hydrophobic interaction znps with virus 125 
 ghaffari et al
 2019 determined the antiviral activity of zinc oxide nanoparticles zno-nps and pegylated zinc oxide nanoparticles against h1n1 influenza virus 126 
 the findings suggest that post-exposure of influenza virus with pegylated zno-nps and bare zno-nps at the highest non-toxic concentrations could be led to 2
8 and 1
2 log10 tcid50 reduction in virus titer when compared to the virus control
 the inhibition rate was much better in pegylated znps compared to unpegylated zno-nps
 zn 2 ions potentially inhibited nidovirus replication and increasing concentration of the intracellular zn 2 concentration can efficiently impair the replication of a variety of rna viruses 127 
 prior incubation of hsv-2 with zinc oxide tetrapod nanoparticles zoten inhibits the ability of the virus to infect vaginal tissue in female balbc mice and blocks virus shedding through neutralizing of virions particles in the host cells and also it stimulate a local immune response 128 
organic nanoparticles are widely used for drug delivery and therapeutic purposes in humans due to their biocompatibility biodegradability and easy surface modification
 the most common organic nanoparticles are polymeric nanoparticles which are colloidal solids ranging from 10 to 1000 nm in diameter
 the small size can facilitate capillary penetration and uptake by cells resulting in increased concentrations at target sites 129 
 polyhexylcyanoacrylate nanoparticles are loaded with either the hiv protease inhibitor saquinavir ro 31-8959 or the nucleoside analog zalcitabine 2 3 -dideoxycytidine

 diphyllin a vacuolar atpase blocker delivered by polymeric nanoparticles consisting of polyethylene glycol-block-polylactide-co-glycolide peg-plga was more effective in inhibiting feline infectious peritonitis fip caused by a mutated feline cov compared to diphyllin alone
 additionally mice were more tolerant toward diphyllin-loaded nanoparticles
 therefore nanoformulation with polymeric nanoparticles yielded potential antiviral activity against fip 133 
the entry of viruses into host cells is complex and the process of interaction between the virus and host cell typically involves specific protein receptors
 for example multivalent flexible nanogels exhibited broad-spectrum antiviral activity by blocking virus entry and infection 134 
 previously several studies used nanospheres for the treatment of hsv hbv and influenza 135 136 137 138 
 altogether organic nanoparticles can serve as drug delivery agents against various types of viral diseases
dendrimers are highly branched symmetrical macromolecular and hyper-branched structures radiating from a central core via connectors and branching units
 terminal groups are essential for targeting and interactions
 dendrimers are globular and contain three different regions-central core branches and terminal functional groups
 the potential functionality of dendrimers is due to encapsulation of several chemical moieties interior layers and multiple surface groups 139 
 in a study performed to determine the effect of various dendrimers on hsv-12 dendrimers bri-2999 and bri-6741 showed significant reduction of infection rates 140 
 two different type of peptide-derivatized dendrimers such as sb105 and sb105 a10 completely inhibited human cytomegalovirus hcmv replication and also inhibited murine cmv replication whereas they were not able to inhibit adenovirus or vesicular stomatitis virus
 the mechanism of inhibition of peptide-derivatized dendrimers namely sb105a10 bound to human cells through an interaction with cell surface heparan sulfate and thereby blocked virion attachment to target cells 141

 polyanionic dendrimers comprising the terminal groups sodium carboxylate hydroxyl and succinamic acid and polycationic dendrimers containing primary amines were used to assess their antiviral activity in mers-cov plaque inhibition assays
 the hydroxyl polyanionic set showed a 17
36-29
75 decrease in mers-cov plaque formation
 all of these dendrimers showed excellent antiviral activity against mers-cov 147 
 the unique properties of dendrimers are due to the presence of numerous surface functional groups which facilitate conjugation with multiple drugs or targeting ligands
 they also have the ability to encapsulate hydrophobic drugs due to their limited cavity size
 vivagel is a g4-poly-l-lysine dendrimer formed from the divalent benzhydylamine amide of l-lysine and it contains 32 terminal anionic functional groups used as an effective antiviral agent 148 
polymers have high antiviral capacity due to their long chains and branches and their flexible molecular design
 polymers can be designed as arbitrary standards based on viricidal effects
 they can be used not only as effective antiviral drugs but also as co-factors for treatment of viral infectious diseases
 polymers carrying antiviral drugs efficiently increase the solubility of antiviral drugs thus prolonging the retention time and enhancing the uptake efficiency of drugs into cells
 for example organotin compounds were prepared according to the needs of universal viral agents 149 
 organotin and cisplatin-like polymers effectively kill viruses by inhibiting viral replication 150 
 the polymers consist of polyphenylene ethynylene ppe-based cationic conjugated polyelectrolytes cpe and oligo-phenylene ethynylenes ope
 they act as antiviral agents by the mechanism of oxidative stress producing singlet oxygen species due to the π bonding system in the backbone of the compound upon exposure to uv-visible light
 the oxidative stress induces damage to macromolecules including dna rna and proteins 151 
 nucleic acid polymers containing hepatitis b surface antigen have been used to treat hepatitis d infection by binding to the amphipathic alpha helix in the class i surface glycoprotein 152 
 polymeric nanogels which are cross-linked hydrogel particles comprising water-soluble and expandable polymers are easily degradable into smaller sized fragments removed by renal clearance
 these polymers can prevent the entry of virus particles into host cells by attaching to the heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the host cell surface
 these flexible nanogels serve as robust inhibitors of hsv-2 virus infections 134 
 chun et al
 2018 designed amphiphilic copolymers comprising methoxy-polyethylene glycol-block polyphenylalanine which consist of encapsulated mir-323a in the core and favipiravir in the exterior layer as both hydrophilic and hydrophobic antiviral agents 153 
 these polymer-carried drugs serve to treat influenza a virus infectious diseases significantly better than naked drug delivery systems without polymers
 the specific advantages of polymers are the sustained release of antiviral agents and the improved metabolic stability of the integrated drug
 these properties demonstrate the great potential of polymeric particles for the successful delivery of antiviral agents 45 
 nanoviricide is a nanomachine that is armed to destroy a particular kind of virus using various types of nanoparticles
 for example polymeric nanoparticles were used to inhibit varicella zoster virus infection in human skin and also polymeric nanoparticles were used for targeted drug delivery to prevent virus spreading and infections
liposomes are spherical in shape with an average size of 20 to 30 nm and are composed of a phospholipid bilayer containing an aqueous core 154 
 hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs can be incorporated into the inner aqueous cavity or the phospholipid bilayer respectively
 liposomes are non-toxic and biocompatible

4 to 10 mgkg body weight a significantly depressed bone marrow cellularity as well as a corresponding decrease in red blood cells blood neutrophils and monocyte numbers were observed
 treatment with liposomal azt significantly reduced virus proliferation using azt alone 156 
 nanocarbon fullerene lipidosome ncfl inhibited influenza virus h1n1 by a direct killing effect which was comparable to that of rimantadine hydrochloride 157 
 to develop broad-spectrum antiviral agents against a variety of viral infections polyunsaturated liposomes pls were fabricated for use in in vivo drug delivery and to specifically target the endoplasmic reticulum
 these pls contained polyunsaturated fatty acids that exhibit independent antiviral activity by reducing cellular cholesterol
 targeting cholesterol biosynthesis within infected cells is one of the promising targets of many viral systems including hcv hbv and hiv 158 
 pls significantly decreased viral infectivity and secretion in hcv hbv and hiv infections
 pretreatment of cells with pls reduced the infectivity of both hcv and hiv by suppressing plasma membrane cholesterol levels
 cationic liposomes containing both a fluorescence marker calcein and antiviral drugs hpmpc cidofovir ®  were internalized in mdbk cells infected with bovine hsv-1 and significantly inhibited viral replication 159 
 norovirus rdrp is used as an antiviral agent and it is a promising target enzyme for the development of new antiviral drugs
 the polysulfonated naphthylurea suramin has the potential to inhibit murine and human norovirus polymerases
 suramin-loaded liposomes exhibited significant antiviral activity against murine norovirus cultivated in raw 264
7 macrophages 160 
 furthermore surmamin inhibited the replication of various chikungunya viral chikv isolates including sindbis virus and semliki forest virus
 various studies revealed that the antiviral activity and mechanism of suramin is through interference with reinitiation of rna synthesis
 the antiviral effect of suramin-containing liposomes potentially prevents and helps treat chikv infections 161 
 acyclovir-loaded flexible membrane vesicles showed significant antiviral activity in a murine model of cutaneous hsv-1 infection
 the lipid based system exhibited safe treatment 162 
 cationic liposomes loaded with stearylamine sa inhibited viral infectivity without preloaded active pharmaceutical ingredients
 sa liposomes suppressed baculoviral infectivity in several mammalian cell lines including a549 cells
 the sa liposomes are non-toxic and could increase antiviral effects by reducing cholesterol content which intensify concurrently with increased binding of sa liposomes to the cell membrane
 sa liposomes potentiate the entry of virus particles into host cells and are compatible with the antiviral drug acyclovir 163 
 hence liposomes are the best carrier molecules to deliver antiviral drugs
antiviral mechanisms of nanoparticles should target attachment penetration replication and budding of viruses
 possible mechanisms involve inactivation of the virus directly or indirectly prevention of attachment of viruses to host cells and blocking viral replication but they also depend on the form and type of nanoparticles used 57 
 most often nanoparticles block the above steps by altering the structure of the capsid protein and eventually reducing virulence which can be attributed to both physical and chemical means of decreasing the active viral load
 for example lara et al
 2010 demonstrated that agnps bind to glycoprotein gp120 of the hiv envelope preventing cd4-dependent virion binding fusion and infectivity in cell-free and cell-associated viral assays 53 164 
 recently cagno et al
 demonstrated the antiviral mechanisms of broad-spectrum non-toxic nanoparticles against hsv human papilloma virus rsv dengue and lenti virus 165 
 the authors showed that a series of antiviral nanoparticles with long and flexible linkers mimicking heparin sulfate proteoglycans the highly conserved target of viral attachment ligands vals could achieve efficient viral prevention
 this was through effective viral association with binding simulated to be strong and multivalent to the val repeating units 165 
 water-soluble fullerene-polyglycerol sulfates prevented interaction of vesicular stomatitis virus coat glycoprotein with baby hamster kidney cells 166 
 lysenko et al
 2018 proposed that one of the main and direct mechanisms of nanoparticle-mediated antiviral activity is linked to local-field action against the receptors at the virus surface 50 
 in this process the nanoparticles adsorbed on the surface of the cell can greatly alter the membrane potential
 on the other hand the indirect antiviral mechanism of nanoparticles includes blocking the penetration of the virus into the cell due to a change in membrane potential
 collectively these reports suggest that the main mechanisms of nanoparticle antiviral activity involve interaction with gp120 competitive binding between the virus and nanoparticles for the host cell interference with viral attachment inhibition of virus-host cell binding and penetration binding to the plasma membrane inactivation of viral particles prior to entry and interaction with double-stranded dna andor binding with viral particles 96 135 164 167 168 169 170 
 while metal nanoparticles interact with viral particles replication of the virus is blocked figure 3 
 andor binding with viral particles 96 135 164 167 168 169 170 
 while metal nanoparticles interact with viral particles replication of the virus is blocked figure 3 
recently cagno et al
 165 demonstrated the state of the art mechanism of non-toxic nanoparticles against various type of viruses
 the authors developed antiviral products which usually mimic heparan sulfate proteoglycans hspg as well-preserved target of viral attachment ligands vals
 the antiviral effect relies on the binding mechanism of the nanoparticles to the virus surface thus preventing virus-cell attachment
 the most outstanding viricidal effect was found in the aunps coated with a 21 mixture of decanesulfonic acid mus and 1-octanethiol ot
 mus allows a multivalent binding as a consequence of its structure comprising a long hydrophobic chain sulfonic acid terminated
 the enhanced activity of musot-nps was assigned to the new construct using mus linker that caused local distortions and then a global virus deformation leading to irreversible loss of infectivity
 the musot-nps exhibited efficient virucidal effect against hsv-1 and hsv-2 human papilloma virus hpv-16 respiratory syncytial virus rsv dengue and lenti virus
 the synthesized musot-nps exhibited toxic to the virus and non-toxic to the host cells 165 
the possible mechanism of antiviral activity of non-toxic nanoparticles such as gold inhibits viral replication and prevent release of viral particles into the host cells
 the inhibition can take place by nanoparticles act as blockers of neuraminidase enzyme which cleaves the attachment between hemagglutinin on the progeny virus and sialic acid receptor on the host cell
 in this case nanoparticles prevent this cleavage step and interfere with the release of progeny virus from infected host cells and subsequently prevent the progression of infection
 therefore the possible antiviral mechanism could be inhibition of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase activities
 in addition like gold nanoparticles blocking attachment of virus into the host cells

over the last decade nanoscience and nanotechnology have played a critical role in nanomedicine due to the size shape and surface charge of nanoparticles as carriers detection agents and direct inhibitory agents against microbes and cancer cells
 nanoparticles have been shown to be efficient and selective agents for the delivery of therapeutic moieties such as drugs vaccines sirnas and peptides
 in addition nanoparticles have been used to detect and monitor diseases and treat responses using noninvasive imaging modalities
 the size of nanomaterials facilitates their involvement in the efficient delivery of antigens due to surface functionalization they have the capability of co-transporting antigens accompanied by numerous adjuvants
 nanomaterials are able to deliver the drug at suitable concentrations in a precise manner to the proper place and at the proper time 171 
an important aspect of nanomaterials in relation to covs is that they are able to inhibit or compete with viral binding to the host cell-surface receptor
 for example the ace2 receptor plays a critical role in the entry of covs into host cells especially in the case of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 172 
 hence blocking andor decreasing the levels of ace2 could help in the fight against infection as well as in the development of antibodies against ace2
 on the other hand ace2 has a protective effect against virus-induced lung injury after infection as a result of increasing the production of the vasodilator angiotensin 1-7 173 
 therefore preventing covid-19 in the host can be more effective than fighting against the virus after infection
 instead of developing vaccines which typically takes a long time and several rounds of protocols and trials it would be better to try to prevent entry of these viruses into humans using nanotechnology for preparing masks clothes gloves and gums by exploiting ace2-coated nanoflowers and qds 174 
 in addition researchers have demonstrated that nanoflowers and ace2-coated qds can be used as bio-detection probes
 furthermore they have been used to enhance catalytic activity and stability of ace2 and also to produce chewing gums nose filters masks clothes and gloves to prevent entry and spread of covs 174 175 
 therefore if materials used in hospitals were prepared with coated nanoparticles the spread of cov infection may be inhibited
 herein we propose a hypothetical antiviral mechanism involving ace2-coated nanoflowers and ace2-coated qds that could block sars-cov-2 entry into cells by inhibiting attachment of the virus to the ace2 protein while also inhibiting activation of the accessory serine protease tmprss2 figure 4 
a nanoparticle-based intranasal delivery system is an effective and safe tool to deliver several therapeutic moieties such as vaccines drugs sirnas peptides and antibodies
 intranasal delivery is noninvasive practical simple and cost effective
 the intranasal delivery system has been evaluated for vaccination against respiratory viruses such as influenza and covs 176 177 
 nanoparticle-mediated delivery systems have the following benefits-free from enzyme degradation long-term existence release and retention within the system amicable co-delivery with adjuvants specific targeting of cells through receptor-ligand interactions and potentiation of the immune system 178 179 
 may be inhibited
 herein we propose a hypothetical antiviral mechanism involving ace2-coated nanoflowers and ace2-coated qds that could block sars-cov-2 entry into cells by inhibiting attachment of the virus to the ace2 protein while also inhibiting activation of the accessory serine protease tmprss2 figure 4 
 there are major challenges in combatting infectious diseases such as sars mers and covid-19 including the fact that there are no effective drugs or vaccines available
 bachmann and jennings 2010 reported that nanoparticles have the potential to enhance transport in the lymphatic system compared to smaller subunit antigens
 virus-like nanoparticles vlnps play a significant role in vaccine development as vaccine carriers and they can stimulate host-immune responses 180 
 nanoparticle-based vaccines have shown much promise in improving vaccine efficacy immunization strategies and targeted delivery
 vlnps improve vaccine efficacy protect the antigens from premature proteolytic degradation facilitate antigen uptake control release and they are non-toxic 181 
 vlnps are composed of a self-assembled viral membrane that forms a monomeric complex displaying a high density of epitopes 182 
 vlnps can accommodate the expression of additional proteins or the endogenous expression of multiple antigens 183 184 
 due to these specific features and unique qualities vlnps can provide protection not only against viruses but also against heterologous antigens 185 
 a host-immune response was generated after the delivery of an antigen using virus capsid protein sv40 in mammalian cells 186 
 vlnps can increase the immunogenicity of weak antigens including salmonella typhi membrane antigen and influenza a m2 protein
 vlnps containing h1v1 nef gonadotropin releasing hormone gnrh assembled and produced a strong antigen-specific humoral response as well as a cellular immune response 187 188 
 vlnps seem to be better carrier molecules owing to their multiple surface antigens compared to antigen presenting cells which can only present one type of antigen on their surface 189 
 another interesting feature of vlnps is their high surface energy which leads to strong adhesion of biomolecules
 these qualities contribute to a virus mimicking effect that stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies and immune cells to fight viral infections 190 191 
 the combination of aunps with an average size of 100 nm and spike s proteins of infectious bronchitis virus exhibited increased stability when used to developed vlnps and showed a significant retention of the s proteins compared to viral antigens 192 
 vlnps mediated the inhibitory effects of mers-cov s protein nanoparticle vaccine and matrix m1 protein adjuvant combination on mers-cov replication in the lungs of mice
 in addition the mers-cov s nanoparticle vaccine produced a high titer of anti-s neutralizing antibodies and protected against mers-cov infection in mice in vivo
 altogether these studies suggest that vlnps conjugated with s protein seem to be a potential design for a successful vaccine not only to stimulate the immune system but also to protect humans from mers-cov
 this approach can also be applied to sars-cov-2 as both covs use the same mechanism of entry into host cells and similar pathogenicity 193 
 taken together nanoparticles can be used as antiviral agents against various types of viruses including sars-cov-2
emerging and reemerging viruses are responsible for a number of recent epidemic outbreaks
 a vital part of controlling of viruses are predicting and controlling of spreading and infections
 although we are developing various kinds of antiviral drugs to stop spreading and infections of deadly viruses the detection of pathogen is very critical in the first place
 therefore researchers are interested to develop sensitive rapid simple technique for accurate characterization of emerging virus strains
 manual magnetic particle-based extraction methods were developed to detect hiv and hcv viral nucleic acids combination with detection by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr one-step
 these methods can be used to routinely screen blood donation for viremic donors 194 
 liu et al
 2013 developed a rapid diagnostic platform for pathogen detection based on the acetylcholinesterase-catalyzed hydrolysis reaction which is comparable to that of pcr and easily detectable through changing of color 195 
 silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles were prepared by co-precipitation method
 these fe 3 o 4 sio 2 nanoparticles were used to isolate genomic dna of hepatitis virus type b hbv and of epstein-barr virus ebv for detection of the viruses based on polymerase chain reaction pcr
 the results depicted that the purification efficiency of dna of both hbv and ebv using obtained fe 3 o 4 sio 2 nanoparticles was significantly better that commercially available reagents 196 
 yeh et al
 2020 developed a portable microfluidic platform containing carbon nanotube arrays with differential filtration porosity for the rapid enrichment and optical identification of viruses 197 
 this technique used to characterize various type of viruses including rhinovirus influenza virus and parainfluenza viruses
 this enrichment method could be used to rapidly track and monitor viral outbreaks in real time
 zhao et al
 2020 developed efficient magnetic nanoparticles-based viral rna extraction method to detect sars-cov-2 which is comparable with pcr techniques 198 
recently sars-cov-2 emerged as a global threat for both healthcare and the economy
 currently a variety of antiviral agents including re-purposed drugs are under testing in clinical trials to assess their efficacy against this new virus but the mission of finding an effective treatment for covid-19 is ongoing 199 200 201 202 
 previously several modes of treatment were practiced against mers and sars infections including the use of inhibitors of viral and host proteases ifns and host-directed therapies
 ribavirin a nucleoside analog that acts as an rna polymerase inhibitor was used on patients with sars and mers 203 204 
 development of new therapies should focus on the cov s protein because it guides the entry of covs into host cells by participating in the binding and fusion of the virus to the ace2 receptor on the host cell membrane
 the s protein is composed of two subunits-s1 recognizes and binds to host receptors and s2 facilitates fusion between the viral envelope and the host cell membrane 205 
 although several agents have been developed using peptide fusion inhibitors anti-cov neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and entry receptor antagonists none of these potentially curative agents is approved for commercial use in humans 206 
 remdesivir an adenosine analogue is a broad-spectrum antiviral with potent in vitro efficacy against multiple genetically-unrelated rna viruses including ebola sars-cov and mers-cov 38 
 remdesivir seems to be an effective antiviral agent against covid-19 207 
 another drug chloroquine has an immunomodulatory effect and functions at both the entry-and post-entry stages of sars-cov-2 infection 208 
 however all of these agents have undesired side effects
 therefore other agents such as nanoparticles need to be explored as alternative antiviral agents
recently nano and nanomediated combination therapy nanoparticles plus antiviral drugs have shown immense promise in nanomedicine
 metal nanoparticles and metal-loaded nanocomposites are known to be extremely effective against microbes and viruses due to their unique property the controlled release of ions
 for example the controlled release of ionic copper is the fundamental aspect for the antimicrobial and antiviral properties of surfaces 209 
 in addition the controlled release of ions favors the production of ros
 metal-grafted go decorated with metals such as ag fe cu zn tio2 cds and mns 2 exhibited potential antiviral activity 77 210 
 for example silver and copper decorated gos are potential antiviral agents for both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses 77 
 the development of nanomaterial-mediated therapy is an alternative to conventional therapies in fighting against resistant viruses 211 
 agnps are able to interact with host receptors and inhibit viral entry
 functionalized aunps showed antiviral activity against hiv-1 and also against h1n1 h3n2 and h5n1 211 
adaptor protein complex 2 ap2-associated protein kinase 1 aak1 is a key regulator of endocytosis
 hence a drug such as baricitinib that inhibits aak1 may suppress viral entry into target cells
 as such baricitinib could be a potential treatment for covid-19 212 
 baricitinib has been shown to bind to another endocytosis regulator cyclin g-associated kinase and inhibit aak1 thus preventing viral entry into the cell 213 
 hiv protease inhibitors such as lopinavir and ritonavirin suppress 3-chymotrypsin-like protease activity of sars-cov and mers-cov 214 
 remdesivir a nucleoside analogue that targets rdrp suppresses viral rna synthesis in a broad spectrum of rna viruses including hcovs
 remdesivir inhibited rdrp of covs in cell cultures and animal models 201 215 
 a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin can potentially increase the recovery of covid-19 patients
 chloroquine-based drugs inhibit the fusion of sars-cov-2 with host cells by acidifying the lysosomes and thus inhibiting cathepsins that require a low ph for optimal cleavage of sars-cov-2 s protein
 these drugs can also alter cross-talk between sars-cov-2 and host cells and reduce production of pro-inflammatory cytokines while activating anti-sars-cov-2 cd8 t-cells 216 217 
infectious diseases cause immense global mortality and viruses are responsible for about one-third of these deaths
 respiratory infections are among the most common causes of death worldwide especially due to covs
 presently the outbreak of viral respiratory infections particularly covid-19 is widespread and continuing to spread worldwide
 as of 27 july 2020 sars-cov-2 the infectious agent of covid-19 had infected 16430566 individuals and led to the death of more than 652434 individuals in 215 countries while also triggering an exceptional economic crisis
 although there are no specific drugs or vaccines to treat or prevent covid-19 the available antiviral drugs are re-purposed drugs and active against a limited panel of human pathogens
 therefore researchers are urgently striving to identify and develop suitable nano-based drugs and nano-vaccines in addition to conventional approaches
 nanotechnology plays a critical role in both viral disease diagnosis and therapeutics
 nanoparticles show great potential for biomedical applications especially in patients who relapse after completing conventional antiviral therapy
 antiviral resistance which is a slowly developing problem of conventional therapeutic approaches may be addressed using nanoparticles due to their large surface-to-volume ratio surface charge size and shape as well as their optical electronic biological and functional properties
 furthermore nano-based approaches are feasible cost effective non-toxic biocompatible and a convenient strategy to deal with various types of viral infections particularly sars-cov-2covid-19
 in this review we have provided a brief account of the main mechanism of entry of viruses into host cells
 we also discussed in detail the effects of several important types of nanomaterials including agnps aunps qds organic nanoparticles liposomes dendrimers and polymers against various types of viral infections
 these functional nanoparticles can provide a novel platform for fabrication of bio-safe and effective drugs for nanoscale treatment of viral infectious diseases
 further we discussed antiviral mechanisms therapeutic approaches of nanoparticles and the effects of nanoparticles on covs
 finally we provide our future perspective of nanoparticles below
nanotechnology has become a focal point of research and various types of nanomaterials have been explored and evaluated for their prophylactic and therapeutic activity against different viruses
 therefore nanoparticle-based therapy seems to be promising but there are still many challenges and barriers to achieve its full potential
 the future focus of antiviral nano-based therapy should concentrate on development of new antiviral therapeutics and approaches to challenge the emergence of drug resistance and different secondary effects due to long-term conventional treatments
 antiviral drugs currently available are effective against a few viral diseases such as influenza hepatitis hsv and hiv
 generally development of an antiviral drug takes a long time years and the process involves tedious protocols particularly for covs due to their variability
 most of the antiviral drugs developed through nanoparticle research show immense potential in in vitro and in vivo conditions however several variables need to be optimized for a successful translation of nanomaterials from the laboratory to the clinical setting
 in addition one important aspect is the non-toxic nature of nanoparticles which require long and intense studies to demonstrate their non-toxic nature let alone their potential activity against specific viruses
 the biotechnanotech industry needs more exposure to demonstrate the effects of nanoparticles on health and their applications in various fields
 the crucial points and future focus of nano-based antiviral drugs need to be on the following important issues
 first the system needs to have receptor-based nanoparticles which could be safely managed as antiviral agents to rapidly target specific viruses
 second functionalization by specific molecules is needed to facilitate effective targeting of specific sites of viral infections
 third non-or reduced-toxicity must remain a priority biocompatibility with no undesired side effects is essential
 fourth a therapeutic approach that combines nanoparticles and low concentrations of antiviral drugs with excellent efficiency is needed
 finally a multidisciplinary consortium is needed to address potential questions related to various types of viruses variability frequent mutations and antiviral agents and their use in humans particularly during pandemic situations as we are now experiencing
 we believe that the approach presented here has a chance to produce medically-relevant antiviral drugs against covs and other viral diseases

the first sars-cov-2-positive cancer patient was identified on an oncology ward on march 18 2020
 the infection occurred in parallel to the primary diagnosis of acute lymphatic leukemia
 all patients on the affected 2 wards were tested the same night and turned out to be sars-cov-2 negative
 this did also account for 36 further staff members e
 the rki had acknowledged this challenge in its recommendation httpswww
 the whole process including the infection chains is highly complex and currently still under investigation
 despite sars-cov-2 infection we were able to continue antileukemic therapy in several patients in urgent need of therapy
 two patients became pcr negative for sars-cov-2 under continued antileukemic therapy
 in total 6 patients out of this cluster needed mechanical ventilation
 two patients 1 elderly patient with refractory acute myeloid leukemia and an  80-year-old patient with end-stage myelofibrosis had died
 as we are able to report so far this led to a complete and successful containment of the situation
 as of today in a governmental effort beds provided for potential sars-cov-2-infected patients are reimbursed at a defined rate
 the transfer of outpatient visits to phone call visits will be translated into economic compensation rates
 early data on 18 patients from china show a 3
5-fold increased risk for intensive care or mechanical ventilation 8 
 the ucch therefore intensified the regular and structural exchange with its 39 contracted patient support groups
 a weekly online newsletter service provides relevant information regarding the covid-19 pandemia in a patient-understandable language

 important offers of the ucch were therefore not cancelled but changed to phone call or video visits
currently the summit of the crisis has most likely not yet been reached in germany
 however in our opinion it is already clear that cancer care will be significantly impacted by the current pandemia
1159000508272 critical benefit-risk assessments and interdisciplinary discussions cannot be ruled out
 guidelines are to be followed but local decisions need to be made
00eaa28403c40a1892c493a5ca2df4ac1e6896f8  with the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemia routine clinical work was immediately deeply and sustainably impacted in germany and worldwide
 the infrastructure of almost all hospitals is currently redirected to provide a maximum of intensive care resources including the necessary staff
 in parallel routine as well as emergency clinical care for all patients in need has to be secured
 this challenge becomes particularly evident in cancer care
 in order to maintain adequate oncological care at all levels of provision and to conduct especially curative and intensive treatments with a maximum of safety continuous adaption of the oncology care system has to be ensured
 intensive communication with colleagues and patients is needed as is consequent expert networking and continuous reflection of the own developed strategies
 in parallel it is of high importance to actively avoid cessation of innovation in order not to endanger the continuous improvement in prognosis of cancer patients
 this includes sustained conduction of clinical trials as well as ongoing translational research
 here we describe measures taken at the university cancer center hamburg ucch -a recognized comprehensive oncology center of excellenceduring the covid-19 crisis
 we aim to provide support and potential perspectives to generate a discussion basis on how to maintain high-end cancer care during such a crisis and how to conduct patients safely into the future
 in hamburg the first case of a sars-cov-2 infection was reported in hamburg in a staff member of the university medical center hamburg-eppendorf uke on february 28 2020
 on march 16 2020 with the beginning of the nationwide lockdown hamburg counted 35 sars-cov-2-positive cases and the university cancer center hamburg ucch started to take the first profound infrastructural measures to protect patients and staff members as well as to prospectively provide resources to face the upcoming challenges of the pandemia
 on april 10 more than 3370 sars-cov-2-positive cases were reported in hamburg more than 250 patients have been treated in hospitals and about 80 of them with intensive care
 the uke continued its extensive preparations to provide a maximum capacity of intensive care beds  150

 dgho esmo ebmt asco as well as selected us cancer centers started to report some guidelines for cancer care 1 2 3 4 
 with a wide spectrum of measures the ucch prospectively and continuously faced the challenges and implications of the covid-19 pandemia
 structural aspects were assessed at all levels in order to assure cancer care with maximum safety
in order to assure the best possible cancer care primarily acknowledging the specific situation in oncology as a first step a cancer center task force was formed on march 18 2020 consisting of representatives from the departments of oncologyhematology bone marrow transplantation radiotherapy and nuclear medicine at the ucch
 this ucch task force acts as the key and central group for decisions on safety and preventive measures general and individual decisions on patient guidance and treatment planning of staff resources changes in the ucch infrastructure as well as the management of sars-cov-2 infections in patients and staff members fig
 1 
 according to the rapid dynamics of the crisis and its continuous implications internally and externally task force meetings are held in a fixed schedule 3 times a week with additional ad hoc meetings whenever needed which has proven to be an effective strategy to achieve maximum preparedness
 the task force holds continuous discussions with the infection prevention and control team and the uke board of directors
 general infrastructural measures were implemented in order to protect patients and staff members as well as to provide human staff resources for subsequent transfer to intensive care units icu
 for treatment guidance general measures were developed
 however also acknowledging that outside existing recommendations for oncological treatments individual treatment modifications may result in ethical conflicts the task force has implemented a dedicated team to discuss individual cases requiring treatment in time
 published statements and guidelines of health authorities and cancer societies are continuously reviewed and implemented
 furthermore the task force provides its knowledge on specific expertise in cancer care e
g
 in palliative treatment to the teams directly involved in the management of sars-cov-2-infected patients
in the following the key measures taken by the task force on patient management and treatment guidance are outlined in detail
after careful internal review the management of outpatient cancer chemotherapy care has been adapted as followsoutpatient cancer care of consultations without active treatment − routine follow-up of previously treated patients at the center are rescheduled after telephone contact as long as patients do not report new symptoms
 − phone call visits are implemented for second-opinion questions and visits for communication of radiographic or laboratory chemistry reports
outpatient care of patients with active treatment − all visits for ongoing treatments and visits in clinical trials are continued as planned
 − adjuvant treatment with curative intent is being conducted whenever possible according to the current guidelines
 − palliative treatments are potentially adapted after review of the individual patients situation
 − all outpatients undergoing active treatment at our outpatient clinic are asked to put themselves into a voluntary quarantine and to wear masks when entering the ucch main building throughout all their visit time
in the palliative setting a careful risk-benefit assessment of ongoing therapies needs to be performed
 this implements consideration of cancer-related life expectancy therapeutic alternatives the individual risk of sars-cov-2 infection in the individual social setting the distance to the oncology center and the general risk given by the planned chemotherapy
 to potentially reduce the frequency of visits during ongoing treatments and to adjust them due to restricted staff resources decisions on stretching treatment intervals or switching to oral applications with less frequent control visits were individually discussed
 all discussions occurred in dedicated teams and were implemented whenever this was assumed to be possible without affecting the patients prognosis
currently we hold on to all those implemented measures which resulted in an overall reduction in outpatient visits of 40-50 per week
inpatient cancer care does not typically involve elective or easily shiftable care
 the timely conduction of all treatments with curative intent is of utmost priority e
g
 treatment of acute leukemias high-grade lymphomas or germ cell cancers
 these treatments are more reflecting acuteemergency admissions rather than routine cancer care
 special precautions and regulations are mandatory for autologous and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantations
 here dedicated hematology societies e
g
 ebmt have proposed guidelines on transplantation procedures 2  which we translated into specific measures
allogeneic transplantations − a consequent reduction in the transplant program except for indications without potential therapeutic alternatives was implemented
 − for all other indications a delay in the transplantation procedure was considered as well as a temporary switch to therapeutic alternatives to delay the procedure to a later time point
autologous transplantations − generally treatment with autologous stem cell transplantation was not discontinued but may be adapted to the patients disease course and risk situation
multiple myeloma − autologous stem cell transplantation is continued without delay in patients with high-risk myeloma and in all patients with suboptimal response to induction treatment or significant toxicity e
g
 peripheral neuropathy during induction therapy
 − all other patients are evaluated for a potential extension of induction treatment to 6-8 cycles or replacement of the high-dose treatment concept with an optimized continuous treatment regimen 5 
malignant lymphoma − in relapsing patients with high-grade non-hodgkins lymphoma or hodgkins disease high-dose treatment with autologous stem cell transplantation is in general conducted as planned
germ cell cancer − for patients with high-dose treatment in relapsing germ cell cancer the best curative treatment option is continued to be performed as planned
outside the transplantation program all inpatients treated with curative intent are tried to be managed as scheduled
 in palliative care the guidelines outlined for outpatient care are applied
in all patients who had started radiotherapy treatment interruptions were avoided in order not to prolong overall treatment time
 all other radiation schedules were reviewed to account for prioritization
 − in case of curative intent the treatment schedule is to be startedcontinued at the earliest opportunity
 − in specific entities where prognosis remains unaffected e
g
 in case of hormonally responsive breast or prostate cancer treatment deferral is discussed individually
 − new patient consultations are triaged on a case-bycase basis following discussion with the referring physician
 − in palliative care treatment is limited to function-or life-threatening situations e
g
 spinal cord compression
 − arthrosis radiation is completely discontinued
whilst deferral may seem preferable for the time being it has to be considered that this may have unintended consequences and create a further unmanageable surge in activity when the crisis has passed
all radiation treatment schedules are adapted if needed based on appropriate evidence-based guidelines nccn astro and estro striving for the shortest possible course e

 breast and prostate cancer 6 
 interdisciplinary cancer care in terms of interdisciplinary care for solid cancer patients the surgical departments have dramatically reduced their elective operation programs while at the same time ensuring immediately necessary cancer surgery to be maintained
 interdisciplinary tumor boards are kept running but partially changed to videoconferences andor limiting the number of participants to one representative decision maker per department involved in the case
 special attention has to be put on avoiding delays in consultation and treatment which may adversely affect potentially curable patients
 however due to potential delays in cancer diagnosis resulting from patients avoiding physician visits in the community and from less intensive diagnostic strategies being conducted in private practice care the number of referrals for cancer surgery has dropped by about 25 in the last 4 weeks
patients enrolled in clinical trials are at particular risk and thus they need more specialized and more intensive staff and investigational resources compared to routine clinical care
 clinical care in line with good clinical practice gcp is therefore a major challenge to be maintained during the covid-19 crisis
 competent authorities and clinical trial sponsors have immediately published short-lived guidelines and measures which have to be translated into a study-specific manner 7 with updates and modifications published weekly
 in general all patients who were already included in clinical trials when the outbreak had started should be treated per protocol and as consequent as possible according to the gcp guidelines
 patient access to clinical trials providing a potentially more effective treatment than the approved treatment options should be continued whenever possible
 in accordance to the suggestions of competent authorities on-site monitoring should be replaced by remote monitoring
 the ucch has developed online solutions and standardized patient consents to enable remote monitoring according to the data protection and gcp rules
 however recruitment into trials has dropped by  50 and new trials are not initiated under the current circumstances according to the authorities recommendations
with the beginning of the covid crisis the ucch task force immediately implemented the first concrete safety measures
 to minimize the potential of viral spread all staff members in the outpatient care were taught to comply with the 1
5-to 2-m distance rules
 obligation for wearing surgical masks for nurses whenever being involved in direct patient care as well as for all physicians when entering the outpatient clinic was implemented
 continuously reviewing the situation 2 days later this measure was expanded to all oncology wards radiotherapy hematologyoncology care palliative care and bone marrow transplantation and again 1 week later it was also implemented for all patients in the outpatient care setting at the university hospital
 this measure was drawn much ahead of the suggestions and guidelines of the uke institution and of the health authorities which were later adapted by themselves and therefore remain up to today
a subsequent challenge addressed was to achieve a maximum of safety for patients scheduled for therapies inducing long-term or high-risk aplasia
 at first the general testing of all patients admitted to the ucch was not possible due to general ucch resource limitations
 however effective from march 25 all patients admitted for intensive chemotherapies with anticipated prolonged aplasia such as leukemia treatments or high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation as well as those with b-cell-directed therapies were admitted to a dedicated area of one of our hematology wards to be immediately tested for a potential sars-cov-2 infection or colonization and kept in protective isolation for 24 h
 with reporting of a pcr-negative test result the patient is transferred to the specialized ward receiving the scheduled treatment
 after repetitive institutional considerations routine testing for sars-cov-2 was expanded to all admissions on all oncology wards by the beginning of april
to minimize the patients contacts with additional persons an early-implemented general ban for all visitors which was effective from march 19 for the cancer center wards had an additional marked beneficial protective effect on hospitalized patients
a broad challenge in human resource management is the daily balance of providing staff support for the growing icu of the university hospital without decreasing high-level cancer care
 in addition it has to be expected that a marked amount of staff members might also be affected by the sars-cov-2 infection or be put under quarantine and thus will not be able to come to work for a defined time
 in order to generate a reliable system all on-duty services of the departments physicians were placed with a dedicated substitute and a specific stepwise plan for staff members switching to the icu team when need was developing
 at the same time the board of di-oncol res treat doi 10
1159000508272 rectors of the uke has allowed the ucch to continue planning their own patient admission schedule to manage the necessary treatment cycles
the first sars-cov-2-positive cancer patient was identified on an oncology ward on march 18 2020
 the infection occurred in parallel to the primary diagnosis of acute lymphatic leukemia
overall the spread of the first sars-cov-2 infection was limited with in total 6 persons proven to be sars-cov-2 positive 1 patient and 5 staff members who were tested positive during their quarantine
 all patients on the affected 2 wards were tested the same night and turned out to be sars-cov-2 negative
 this did also account for 36 further staff members e
g
 physicians nurses psychooncologists and physiotherapists regarded at increased risk for transmission category i  15 min face-to-face contact to the infected patient without protection according to the guidelines of the german health authority robert koch institute rki
 the enormous number of contact persons identified also clearly showed the impact of 1 affected patient on the infrastructure in a hospital with several staff members having to be put immediately into quarantine
 this example also elucidated that the quarantine rules are per se not always feasible in a center running with highvolume and high-quality cancer care which requires a large amount of highly qualified staff
 the rki had acknowledged this challenge in its recommendation httpswww
 rki

internet061doc13848752bodytext2
 for our center additional repetitive sars-cov-2-specific pcr monitoring of asymptomatic staff 5 6 7 and 9 days after the last at-risk contact was implemented
 even more important implementation of consequent staff protection rules by the task force had the goal to consequently avoid category i contacts
 this accounts for direct patient care with adequate mask protection but also restrictions and protection during regular personal exchanges among nurses and physicians
 in this context it has to be mentioned that all contacts with low risk of transmission category ii  15 min face-to-face contact to the infected patient were offered testing on a voluntary basis 7 days after the last at-risk contact by the institution
 all staff members tested in the follow-up monitoring of asymptomatic personnel 5 6 7 or 9 days after the last at-risk contact turned out to be negative
 overall the liberal testing offered for employees by the uke turned out to be positive in the sense of patient and staff protection it enables early identification of oligo-and asymptomatic but infected staff members and therefore also identifies those who come to work despite being affected but have the immediate wish to help in a crisis of limited resources
including the first 2 patients described a cluster of overall 22 cancer patients with a sars-cov2 infection was identified between march 18 and the so far preliminary end point april 24 including patients affected by hematological cancers leukemia lymphoma and multiple myeloma
 these cases which have led to an extensive screening of all patients in our center as well as all the various staff members
 the whole process including the infection chains is highly complex and currently still under investigation
 as mentioned before the first detected infection was most likely imported into our center by an outpatient with primary diagnosis of acute lymphatic leukemia who was concomitantly affected by covid-19
 at a time point more than 2 weeks later when the majority of patients of the general cluster was diagnosed with sars-cov-2 the staff members of all oncology wards were already working under mask protection
 also screening procedures for sars-cov-2 on the oncology wards and for patients admitted with hematological cancers and the general ban for all visitors had been implemented and indeed the majority of patients affected had actually been tested negative for sars-cov-2 before admission or during their inpatient stay
 all infected cancer patients were transferred from the oncology center to a dedicated covid ward of the uke guided by an interdisciplinary dedicated team of physicians specialized in general internal medicine and oncology
 the oncology team is solely situated in the covid-19 area of the main uke building and acts completely separately from the ucch in order to provide and continue cancer treatment for sars-cov-2-positive patients on the above-mentioned specialized ward and on the icu
 despite sars-cov-2 infection we were able to continue antileukemic therapy in several patients in urgent need of therapy
 two patients became pcr negative for sars-cov-2 under continued antileukemic therapy
 the clinical course of sars-cov-2 infection was highly variable ranging from asymptomatic to oligosymptomatic cases up to severe covid-19-affected lung disease
 in total 6 patients out of this cluster needed mechanical ventilation
 two patients 1 elderly patient with refractory acute myeloid leukemia and an  80-year-old patient with end-stage myelofibrosis had died
 in the context of the sars-cov-2 cluster main extended measures taken were containment of 4 wards for 2 weeks repetitive and complete screening of all admitted patients and all staff members of the center including those without direct patient contacts and the change from standard to ffp2 masks in the whole building
 as we are able to report so far this led to a complete and successful containment of the situation
 the economic aspects of the covid-19 crisis in the ucch but also in general for the academic health system are currently unpredictable
 as of today in a governmental effort beds provided for potential sars-cov-2-infected patients are reimbursed at a defined rate
 as all wards involved in cancer care are mainly unaffected by those regulations when patients admitted are of unmet therapy need the financial gap might be not as large as in other disciplines
 the overall resource utilization in the ucch wards was  90 during march clearly indicating that inpatient cancer treatment cannot be paused during the virus pandemic outbreak
 however a more stringent isolation policy with more single room use and use of inpatient resources for testing will reduce the number of patients treated
 the transfer of outpatient visits to phone call visits will be translated into economic compensation rates
 in our opinion all efforts have to be done to avoid financial restrictions in cancer care now and in the near future
acting as a long-term funded center of excellence by the german cancer aid dkh the ucch consists of an established partner network of 19 office-based oncologists and 20 contracted surrounding partner hospitals
 the ucch acknowledged its central coordinating role in this network during the covid-19 pandemia to assure ongoing optimized care for all patients affected by cancer in the region
 in parallel we see the utmost responsibility as a cancer center to provide all available resources to generate the maximum scientific information out of this severe crisis to improve the management of similar events in the future as well as the current crisis
on march 20 2020 the ucch launched the first online oncology platform which provides a forum to actively communicate foreseeable or unforeseeable capacity limitations of cancer care at specific hospital locations and to consequently connect partners in need with those who can potentially provide free capacities ucch-covid-helpuke
de
 in parallel the platform is constantly being developed as a forum to exchange relevant information over the pandemia development emerging medical insights as well as guidelines and expert opinions
in the extensive considerations about the optimal cancer care during the current pandemia it is obvious that only very limited data exist about the clinical course of the sars-cov-2 infection in cancer patients
 early data on 18 patients from china show a 3
5-fold increased risk for intensive care or mechanical ventilation 8 
 however the implication of different oncology entities and specific treatment modalities the impact of immunosuppression aplasia or other distinct high-risk situations are unclear so far
 this is even more relevant as current data suggest a potential role of a cytokine storm leading to potentially severe lung impairment
 consequently the question arises if specific drugs used in oncological treatment such as immune-oncological treatments monoclonal antibodies or targeted therapies might potentially also have a distinct effect on the clinical course
 to address these questions the ucch and its network together with the university hospitals in kiel and lübeck have now initiated a prospective observational trial where sars-cov-2 infections in cancer patients are systematically reported including prospective biobanking of peripheral blood samples
cancer patients are now not only affected by the diagnosis of the malignant disease but also by all concerns arising during the covid-19 pandemia
 in addition to the already existing existential fears anxiety is also associated with a potential sars-cov-2 infection and the potential general infrastructural restrictions regarding radiographic investigations surgical interventions delays in treatment or limitations regarding access to the oncology centers
 the limitations in staff resources during the pandemia is in opposition to the need of even more time for explanations to the individual cancer patient
 the ucch therefore intensified the regular and structural exchange with its 39 contracted patient support groups
 a weekly online newsletter service provides relevant information regarding the covid-19 pandemia in a patient-understandable language
 psychooncology support consultations in complementary medicine sports and nutrition counseling i
e
 important offers of the ucch were therefore not cancelled but changed to phone call or video visits
currently the summit of the crisis has most likely not yet been reached in germany
 how many patients will need mechanical ventilation or how that in reality will affect the staff resources of all other departments is so far not predictable and may also be of different extent in different federal regions
 however in our opinion it is already clear that cancer care will be significantly impacted by the current pandemia
 although we are convinced that cancer care can still be provided for all patients in need potential disadvantages for individual patients despite sars-cov-2 covid-19 and cancer 7 oncol res treat doi 10
1159000508272 critical benefit-risk assessments and interdisciplinary discussions cannot be ruled out
 furthermore we have to anticipate that due to the current changes in social behavior and resources cancer diagnosis will be delayed and more patients will be diagnosed in the near future at a more advanced stage
 the unrestricted access for patients to the innovative technologies in oncology to clinical trials second opinions and center-specific treatments will not be kept up as before the covid-19 pandemia
 the temporary shutdown in translational research will lead to a delay in relevant and groundbreaking findings which will extend far beyond the time of the pandemia fundamental experiments will be delayed grant applications will not be submitted in time and manuscripts will potentially not be completed
 in parallel relevant third-party funding will be redirected towards funding to unravel the burden of the sars-cov-2 infection and covid-19
 cancellation of conventions and meetings will negatively impact the scientific exchange in the expert community and will lead to a lack in interdisciplinary and multinational networks
 high-ranked political initiatives such as the national decade against cancer in germany or the european beating cancer plan are in danger of significant slowdown
 the german cancer center heidelberg dkfz and the german cancer aid dkh have initiated a process to monitor the conduction of cancer care and research in the dedicated german comprehensive cancer centers
 guidelines are to be followed but local decisions need to be made
 facing all those challenges it is now the time to use the current unprecedented team spirit and solidarity which is also generated during this crisis as an alternative strategy for knowledge generation and transfer
 cancer does not stop
 day by day we all have to face the responsibility to secure cancer care for all patients and to continue to optimize cancer treatment to promote the innovation and to provide simultaneously unrestricted support while offering staff and knowledge to our colleagues fighting in the icus against this devastating pandemia with the common aim to overcome this critical crisis

 our frequency range is restricted to the most sensitive band of the gw detectors namely 20-500 hz
 while gravitational radiation from core-collapse supernovae is expected to contain frequency content above this band radice et al
 2019  detection of bursts above a few hundred hz is not energetically favorable see e
 2019a  and increasing the frequency upper limit also increases the computational cost
 the maps are scanned for clusters of pixels with excess energy referred to as events
 these are based on correlations between data in different detectors and reject events associated with noise transients
 the surviving event with the largest ranking statistic is taken to be the best candidate for a gw detection
 its significance is evaluated in the same way as the modelled analysis but with 660 s long off-source trials
 in order to ensure that the significance is assessed at a sub-percent level we require at least ∼ 1
5 hours of coincident data from at least two detectors around the time of a grb
 non-gaussian noise transients or glitches are handled as described in abbott et al
 these models are intended to represent the gws from stellar collapses
 2020d for the detectability of corecollapse supernovae
 this indicates that no gw signal was uncovered in association with any of these grbs
 this is consistent with the estimated gw-grb joint detection rate with fermi-gbm of 0

5 × 10 −3 grb 190804058 and 2
7 × 10 −2 grb 190601325 respectively
 both cumulative distributions are within the 2σ lines and therefore compatible with the no-signal hypothesis
 these figures indicate that the lowest p-value found by each search is compatible with the no-signal hypothesis
 we apply a weighted binomial test described in abadie et al

in addition to confirming the origin of some short grbs combining data from observations of gw170817 and grb 170817a allowed for the inference of basic properties of short grb jets

 2017 
 these jets are thought to be collimated and roughly axisymmetric emitting preferentially in a narrow opening angle due to a combination of outflow geometry and relativistic beaming
 the data from extensive multi-wavelength observation campaigns that ran for nearly 20 months following the merger troja et al

 further according to one of the models proposed as the jet drills through the surrounding merger ejecta it inflates a mildly relativistic cocoon due to interactions between the material at the edge of the jet and the ejecta lazzati et al

a targeted search for gws in sky and time coincidence with grbs enhances our potential of achieving such joint detections

1 for details
 these searches were able to process 105 and 32 grbs in o3a respectively
the scope of these targeted searches is to enhance our ability to detect gw signals in coincidence with grbs with respect to all-sky searches for transient gw signals carried out by the ligo-virgo collaboration abbott et al
 2019c abbott et al
  2020c 
 these may lead to joint gw-grb detections in the case of loud gw events as for gw170817 and grb 170817a but the targeted searches we report on here aim at uncovering subthreshold gw signals by exploiting the time and localization information of the grbs themselves
 the fermi gamma-ray burst monitor gbm team conducts an analogous effort when searching through gbm data for gamma-ray transients coincident with confirmed events and low significance candidates reported by ligo-virgo offline analyses hamburg et al
 2020 
 similarly the swiftburst alert telescope bat team has developed their own autonomous pipeline to enable subthreshold grb searches for externally triggered events tohuvavohu et al

 setting the false-alarm-rate threshold to two per year 39 compact binary coalescence events were identified in o3a abbott et al

 this makes the secondary compact object either the lightest bh or the heaviest ns known to be in a compact binary system
while there is considerable uncertainty in source type for all three of these events gw190425 is the one for which the prospects of observing an associated grb were most promising as it is consistent with a bns merger rather than a binary bh merger or a nsbh merger with high or moderately high mass ratio
 however no confirmed electromagnetic or neutrino counterparts were observed in association with this event hosseinzadeh et al
 2019  lundquist et al
 2019  abbott et al
 2020a  coughlin et al
 2020  but also see pozanenko et al
 2020  despite extensive searches which are logged in the gamma-ray coordinates network gcn circular archive
 1 there are a number of reasons for which an electromagnetic counterpart associated with gw190425 may not have been detected
 firstly the large area covered by the localization region of gw190425 determined from gw data  8000 deg 2  posed a considerable challenge for electromagnetic follow-up
 45
4 of this localization region was occulted by the earth for the fermi satellite so if gamma-rays were emitted from the source it is possible they were not detectable
 other gamma-ray observatories with lower sensitivities to short grbs such as integral and konus-wind were covering relevant fractions of the localization region however martin-carrillo et al
 2019 svinkin et al
 2019 
 secondly grb jets are expected to be aligned with the total angular momentum of the binary system and thus more easily detectable at small viewing angles
 the binary inclination angle of gw190425 was poorly constrained so it is possible that a jet from this system was formed but was oriented away from our line of sight
 additionally the luminosity distance inferred for gw190425 ∼ 160 mpc was significantly larger than that for gw170817 ∼ 40 mpc
 grb 170817a which followed gw170817 was such an exceptionally faint short grb abbott et al
 2017a  that its prompt emission photon flux would have dipped below the detection threshold for fermi-gbm had the source had been farther than ∼ 75 mpc the grb abbott et al
 2017a goldstein et al
 2017  and by ∼ 100 mpc it would become undetectable by swiftbat tohuvavohu et al
 2020 
 thus if emission from the system that produced gw190425 was similarly faint it would not have been detectable by swiftbat or fermi-gbm
 therefore we do not necessarily expect a grb detection to be associated with gw190425 due to its almost unconstrained inclination angle large localization region and distance even if gamma-rays were emitted from this system
 scenarios like this one further motivate the need for gw follow-up analyses of grb events which by definition constrain the sky localization and inclination angle of the progenitor
in section 2 we discuss the set of grbs analyzed in this paper
 in section 3 we summarize the two targeted search methods used to follow up grbs
 section 4 presents the results obtained with these two methods
 we also consider each of the two sets of results collectively and quantify its consistency with the no-signal hypothesis
 finally in section 5 we provide our concluding remarks
the sample of grbs analyzed in this paper includes events circulated by the gcn 2 complemented with information from the swiftbat catalog lien et al
 2016  3 the online swift grbs archive 4 and the fermi gbm catalog
 5 gruber et al
 2014 von kienlin et al
 2014 narayana bhat et al
 2016  once an alert detailing an event has been received via the gcn the dedicated vetting automation and literature informed database valid coyne 2015 is applied to find the latest grb results by comparing the time and localization parameters with those in tables relating to each satellite the published catalogs and an automatic literature search
 the gcn notices provide a set of 141 grbs during the o3a data taking period 1 april 2019 1500 utc -1 october 2019 1500 utc
as mentioned in the introduction we carry out two searches with distinct assumptions about signal morphology see sec
 3 for details on both methods a search for generic gw transients and a modelled search for gw signals from ns binary i
e
 bns and nsbh inspirals
 we do this because grbs of different dura-tions are expected to have different origins and therefore different gw signal morphologies
 in particular if a compact binary merger were to produce a grb it would be expected to have a short duration
 in order to specifically target such phenomena with the modelled search we classify each grb as long short or ambiguous
 this classification relies on the measurement of the time interval over which 90 of the total backgroundsubtracted photon counts are observed t 90  with error δt 90 
 when t 90  δt 90   2 s the grbs are labeled as short when t 90 − δt 90   4 s the grbs are labeled as long the rest are labelled as ambiguous
 the unmodelled search for generic transients is applied to grbs of all classifications
 all of the short and ambiguous grbs are additionally analyzed with the modelled search in order to maximize the chances of uncovering any potential binary coalescence candidate
the classification process results in 20 short grbs 108 long grbs and 13 ambiguous grbs
 as in abbott et al
 2019b we require a minimum amount of coincident data from at least two gw detectors around the time of a grb for the generic unmodelled gw transient search to assess the significance of a gw candidate with sub-percent level accuracy see sec
 3
2 for technical details

 all three fall beyond the detection range of our interferometers and are not expected to produce measurable gw results
 regardless of availability of redshift information however we follow up as many grbs as we can and we were indeed able to analyze these three cases

this analysis searches for a gw signal compatible with the inspiral of a bns or nsbh binary -collectively ns binaries -within 6 s of data associated with an observed short grb
 this stretch of data is the onsource window and runs from −5 s to 1 s around the start of the grb emission i
e
 the grb trigger time
 the surrounding ∼30-90 minutes of data are split into 6 s off-source trials which are also analyzed in order to build a background
 ∼30 minutes allow the modelled search to accurately estimate the power spectral density of the available instruments and ensures that it can assess at sub-percent level accuracy the significance of any candidate events found in the on-source window
 all the data is processed with pygrb harry  fairhurst 2011 williamson et al

 aside from the updated sensitivity of our detectors the only difference with respect to the second ligo-virgo observing run abbott et al

 we only search for circularly polarized gws which may be emitted by binaries with inclinations of 0 • or 180 •  such systems have gw amplitudes that are consistent williamson et al

the strength of any potential signal is ranked via a coherent matched filter signal-to-noise ratio snr harry  fairhurst 2011 williamson et al
 2014  which is reweighted according to a χ 2 goodness-of-fit between the template that identified it and the signal itself
 the significance of the latter is quantified as the probability of background alone producing such an event
 this is evaluated by comparing the re-weighted snr of the loudest trigger within the 6 s on-source to the distribution of the re-weighted snrs of the loudest triggers in the 6 s off-source trials
 when data from more than one detector is available this background snr distribution is extended by generating additional off-source trials via time slides that is by combining data from detectors after introducing time shifts longer than the light-travel time across the network
 specifically our time shifts are 6 s long in order to match the width of the on-source window and the off-source trials
in order to derive the sensitivity of this search to potential grb sources simulated signals are injected in software into the off-source data
 the 90 50 exclusion distances d 90 d 50  are defined as the dis-tances within which 90 50 of the injected simulated signals are recovered with a greater ranking statistic than the loudest on-source event
 three different astrophysical populations are considered bns binaries with generically oriented -i
e
 precessing -spins aligned spin nsbh binaries and nsbh binaries with generically oriented spins
 these simulated signals cover a portion of parameter space that extends beyond the one covered by the template bank as they include ns dimensionless spin values up to 0
4 and for two families of injected signals admit precession
 as stated previously the templates used to filter the data are produced using imrphenomd
 in order to factor into the sensitivity assessment any potential loss due to uncertainties in gw signal modeling the injected signals are not produced with the same model used for the templates

 injected signals have a range of total inclinations from 0 • -30 • and 150 • -180 • whilst removing any systems which could not feasibly produce a short grb pannarale  ohme 2014
x-pipeline looks for excess power that is coherent across the network of gw detectors and consistent with the sky localization and time window for each grb
 as in the first two observing runs we use a search time win-dow that begins 600 s before the grb trigger time and ends 60 s after it or at the t 90 time itself whichever is larger
 this window is long enough to encapsulate the time delay between gw emission from a progenitor and the grb prompt emission koshut et al

 our frequency range is restricted to the most sensitive band of the gw detectors namely 20-500 hz
 while gravitational radiation from core-collapse supernovae is expected to contain frequency content above this band radice et al
 2019  detection of bursts above a few hundred hz is not energetically favorable see e

 fig

 2019a  and increasing the frequency upper limit also increases the computational cost
the generic transient search pipeline coherently combines data from all detectors and produces timefrequency maps of this gw data stream
 the maps are scanned for clusters of pixels with excess energy referred to as events
 the events obtained this way are first ranked according to a detection statistic based on energy and then subject to coherent consistency tests
 these are based on correlations between data in different detectors and reject events associated with noise transients
 the surviving event with the largest ranking statistic is taken to be the best candidate for a gw detection
 its significance is evaluated in the same way as the modelled analysis but with 660 s long off-source trials
 in order to ensure that the significance is assessed at a sub-percent level we require at least ∼ 1
5 hours of coincident data from at least two detectors around the time of a grb
 non-gaussian noise transients or glitches are handled as described in abbott et al
 2019b 
similarly to the modelled search we quantify the sensitivity of the generic transient search by injecting simulated signals into off-source data in software and recovering them
 calibration errors are accounted for by jittering the amplitude and arrival time of the injections according to a gaussian distribution representative of the calibration uncertainties in o3a abbott et al

 these models are intended to represent the gws from stellar collapses

during o3a we used the generic transient method to follow up a total of 105 grbs whereas the modelled search was applied to the 32 grb triggers classified as short or ambiguous
 for all of the most gw-signallike triggers associated with the examined grbs the searches returned no significant probability of incompatibility with background alone p-value
 this indicates that no gw signal was uncovered in association with any of these grbs
 this is consistent with the estimated gw-grb joint detection rate with fermi-gbm of 0

 2019b 10 −2 10 −1 10 0 p-value for the 2019-2020 ligo-virgo observing run
 the most significant events found by the generic transient method and by the modelled search had p-values of 5
5 × 10 −3 grb 190804058 and 2
7 × 10 −2 grb 190601325 respectively
 figures 1 and 2 show the cumulative distributions of p-values returned by the modelled search and the generic transient search respectively
 for cases in which no associated on-source trigger survived the analysis cuts of the modelled search the associated p-value ranges between 1 -i
e
 an upper bound on a probability -and the fraction of background trials for the grb that also yielded no associated gw trigger
 in both figures the expected background distribution under the no-signal hypothesis is shown by the dashed line and its 2σ limits are indicated by the two dotted lines
 both cumulative distributions are within the 2σ lines and therefore compatible with the no-signal hypothesis
 these figures indicate that the lowest p-value found by each search is compatible with the no-signal hypothesis
having found no gw signal associated with the grbs followed up by our searches we consider the set of modelled search results and the set of generic transient search results collectively
 we apply a weighted binomial test described in abadie et al
 2012 to evaluate how consistent each set of results is collectively with the no-signal hypothesis
 this test is conducted using the most sig- 
 cumulative histograms of the 90 confidence exclusion distances d90 for the bns blue thin line and generically spinning nsbh orange thick line signal models shown for the sample of 32 short and ambiguous grbs that were followed up by the ns binary modelled search during o3a all of which did not have an identified gw counterpart
 for a given grb event and signal model d90 is the distance within which 90 of simulated signals inserted into off-source data are recovered with greater significance than the most significant on-source trigger
 these simulated signals have inclinations θjn -the angle between the total angular momentum and the line of sight -drawn uniformly in sin θjn with θjn restricted to 0nificant 5 of p-values in the sample weighted by a prior probability of detection estimated using the network detector sensitivity at the time and location of each grb
 this final probability of observing this distribution of pvalues given background alone i
e
 under the no-signal hypothesis is 0
43 0
31 for the modelled generic transient search method
 therefore both searches gave no significant evidence for a population of unidentified subthreshold gw signals
 for the analyses carried out in the first observing run of advanced ligo and advanced virgo o1 the combined p-values were 0
57 and 0
75 for the modelled and generic transient search respectively abbott et al

 2019b 
in fig
 3  we show the cumulative 90 exclusion distances for the 32 short and ambiguous grbs followed up with the modelled search
 the lowest exclusion distance values ∼ 20 mpc were obtained for ambiguous grb 190409901
 this is due to the fact that only virgo data was available for this grb and that the sky location of this event was in a direction in which virgo had ∼ 30 sensitivity with respect to an optimal sky location
 for each of the three simulated signal classes we quote the median of the 32 d 90 results in the top part of table 1 
 all three values are 40-60  times higher than those reported in abbott et al
 2019b for the previous ligo-virgo observing run
 the individual d 90 values for each class of simulated signals are reported in table  2  at the end of this paper
 as a term of comparison during the six month duration of o3a the hanford and livingston advanced ligo instruments and the virgo interferometer had bns ranges 8 of 108 mpc 135 mpc and 45 mpc respectively
 we also place a 90 confidence level lower limit on the distance for each of the 105 grbs analyzed by the generic transient search assuming the various emission models discussed in sec

5 •  we searched glade dálya et al
 2018 for galaxies within 200 mpc
 we then compared the angular separation between each grb and galaxy and recorded all separations less than or equal to twice the error radius for each grb
 of the 141 events in our sample 4 had nearby galaxies according to the definition above grb 190530430 grb 190531840 grb 190610a and grb 190731943 
 data for our gw follow-up analysis was available only in the case of the short grb 190610a first observed by swiftbat evans et al
 2019  and localized to within a 90 error radius of 1

 on the edge of its localization region there is a nearby galaxy at a luminosity distance of approximately 165 mpc z  0

 9 the angular separation between the center of the localization region and the nearby galaxy is at the 2
21σ-level relative to the formal fit error which is slightly less conservative than the quoted 90 localization derived from snr and is consistent with expectations of angular offsets from a host galaxy at that distance 
 we did not find any gw signal associated to grb 190610a in the data available from the two ligo detectors virgo data was not in observing mode at that particular time
 our modelled search described in sec

1 which uses an on-source window from −5 s to 1 s around the grb trigger time placed 90 confidence exclusion distances of 63 mpc 82 mpc and 114 mpc for bns binaries with generically oriented spins nsbh binaries with generically oriented spins and aligned spin nsbh binaries see sec

1 for more details on these three populations
 in general a distance of 165 mpc can be within the reach of our modelled search but grb 190610a was in a sky location such that the sensitivity of both detectors was less than 30 of what it would have been in an optimal sky location
we carried out targeted analyses for gws associated to fermi and swift grbs reported during the o3a ligo-virgo observing run
 in the case of short and ambiguous grbs events see sec
 2 we ran a modelled search for ns binary merger signals harry  fairhurst 2011 williamson et al
 2014  while an unmodelled search for gw transient signals was performed for all grbs sutton et al
 2010 was et al
 2012 
 as a result of our analyses we found no gw signal in association with the grbs that we followed up
 this is consistent with the previously predicted rate of coincident detections of 0
1-1
4 per year for the third observing run of advanced ligo and advanced virgo abbott et al
 2017a 
 additionally by carrying out a weighted binomial test we found no strong evidence for a population of unidentified subthreshold gw signals in our results
 we set lower bounds on the distances to the progenitors of all grbs we analyzed for a number of emission models
 these d 90 values are reported in table 3  along with other information about each grb that we considered this includes timing sky location observing instrument and gw detectors with available data
 the 90 confidence level exclusion distances achieved in this run include the largest values published so far for some individual grbs cfr
 abbott et al
 2017c abbott et al
  2019b 
 among the grbs we analyzed is grb 190610a the sky localization of which included a nearby galaxy at a luminosity distance of 165 mpc
 we placed 90 confidence level exclusion distances lower than this value for ns binary merger gw signals and are therefore unable to rule out the possibility that grb 190610a happened in such galaxy

 1 3 improving detection of pathogens from bal specimens is critical to guide antimicrobial management direct infection prevention and control strategies understand potential changes in epidemiology and avoid more invasive diagnostic interventions for example lung biopsy
 prior studies of bal performed in immunocompromised children have reported detection of pathogens in 28-68 mean 50 of procedures using a variety of case definitions and patient populations
 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 however few recent studies have examined the diagnostic yield of bal in the immunocompromised pediatric population and compared the yield of different diagnostic assays
thus the primary aim of this study was to determine the overall diagnostic yield of bals in immunocompromised children over the past decade and to compare the rates of isolation of bacterial fungal viral and mycobacterial pathogens in the early 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 versus later 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 years of the study period
 we hypothesized that the diagnostic yield of bals performed in the earlier years of the study would be lower than bals performed during the later years due to improvements in diagnostic assays
 the secondary aim was to determine if bal results were associated with changes in antimicrobial therapy

demographic and clinical characteristics were collected from the emr
 in patients who underwent autologous hsct followed by a planned allogeneic hsct the date and degree of myeloablation 13 of the first hsct were used in the analysis
 radiographic findings suggestive of lrti for example nonspecific opacities nodules and ground glass opacities were abstracted from attending radiologists electronic reports of computed tomography ct performed within 10 days of bal when available or chest radiographs if a recent ct had not been performed
 radiographic findings reported for 5 of subjects i

 scarring mass reticulations increased attenuation were excluded from analysis as the study was not powered to detect an association between such findings and potential pathogens

in this study we describe a large cohort of immunocompromised children who underwent bal over a 12-year period and found that the infectious diagnostic yield of bal was 31
 we did not identify demographic or clinical risk factors associated with detection of a potential pathogen
 subjects who had undergone hsct andor who had received more myeloablative conditioning regimens were not more likely to have a detectable pathogen
 however radiographic findings of nonspecific opacities ground glass opacities and nodules were more likely to be associated with isolation of a potential pathogen the presence of such findings may therefore have clinical utility in the decision to perform bal in immunocompromised children
the rate of positive bals in previous studies has ranged from 28 to 68 as shown in table  4  4-57-1014-16 and this variability likely reflects institutional differences in patient populations bal testing modalities and local epidemiology of pathogens
 4 14 perhaps more importantly the case definitions for pathogenic microorganisms has varied in contrast to the current study some studies have included cons and mixed commensal flora as pathogenic
 4 5 yet others have variously excluded isolates of cmv candida spp
 ntm and aspergillus spp
 as airway contaminants
 4 6 9 contrary to our hypothesis the rate of isolation of potential pathogens was higher in the earlier years of the study than in later years although not statistically significant despite the fact that significantly more samples were submitted for fungal and cmv cultures in the later study period
 our results indicate that the majority of patients were on multiple antimicrobials at the time of bal and this may have affected culture results
 additionally during the last two decades isolation of viral microorganisms from bal has decreased overall 5 15 which may reflect improving antiviral prophylaxis in patients who are cmvseropositive
 the decreasing incidence of pneumocystis pneumonia due to prophylaxis against this organism is also well documented
 17 furthermore negative bals may have reflected non-infectious causes of lower tract disease such as graft-versushost disease or pulmonary fibrosis as has been previously described
 2 10 16 18 19 recent comparison studies have suggested that lung biopsy may elucidate noninfectious diagnoses in a manner superior to that of bal 20 21 22 though this procedure is associated with higher morbidity and mortality than bal
our study supports the observations made in prior series that a positive result from bal impacts treatment decisions
 4 8 20 we found that most negative bals were associated with discontinuing at least one non-targeted antimicrobial although often another non-targeted agent was continued
 in addition the majority of positive bals were associated with changing to targeted antimicrobials for viral or mycobacterial pathogens
 thus prescribing was improved following 119 68
4 of 174 bals
this single center retrospective study had limitations
 not all diagnostic tests were performed for every bal and we were unable to consistently determine the reason for this
 we also did not examine whether indication for bronchoscopy e
g
 fever worsening respiratory status radiographic findings was associated with detection of potential pathogens
 furthermore we could not assess the usefulness of rt-pcr for respiratory viral pathogens as our institution introduced this technology in may 2012 nor could we assess the usefulness of aspergillus galactomannan as so few tests were sent
 furthermore quantitative bal analysis was unavailable during the study period
 the study was not sufficiently powered to detect the association of relapse refractory disease type of chemotherapy or different conditioning regimens on the yield of bals
 we did not analyze the association of neutropenia with the yield of bal or with radiographic findings
 finally we could not conclusively determine providers rationale for continuing non-targeted therapy or discontinuing targeted therapy
bal contributes to treatment decision-making in immunocompromised patients with presumed lrti and continues to have a role in the care of this population
 a multicenter study should be performed to validate a case definition for positive bals to examine the relative contribution of newer diagnostic modalities and to further assess the impact of bals on antimicrobial management

 should they not make contact by the specified time a member of the research team will contact the volunteer
 if no contact is made then a prior defined secondary contact will be telephoned
the study primary outcomes are carriage at 48 hours andor 7days in inoculated volunteers
 this will be determined by culture of the 48 hour -7 day nasal wash sample
secondary endpoints are immunological parameters and further bacterial carriage characterisation
 in particular innate humoral and cellular responses to pneumococcal proteins and polysaccharide measured in serum saliva nasal wash
cellular responses -nasal washings saliva and bal will be examined by giemsa stained cytospin for recruitment of neutrophils
 in addition the number of macrophages and the apoptotic fraction of these macrophages will be determined if possible
 it may be possible to use transcriptomic techniques to examine cellular rna if whole cell analyses are not possible
 some immunoglobulin responses may alter adhesion or be anti-inflammatory
 antigen specific cd4 t cell responses are critical in defence against pneumococcal carriage 2 in animal models
 we will determine these responses in nasal wash if possible above and bal samples using multi-parameter flow cytometry 4 
 we will compare volunteers baseline and post-carriage observations to determine response to carriage
 none of these methods are clinically validated and so we will use conventional techniques to determine the primary endpoint
 we will also characterise the dynamics of co-colonisation particularly of s
pneumoniae with staphylococci and haemophilus spp in collaboration with emory university
pneumococcus is responsible for infections including otitis media om sinusitis pneumonia bacteraemia and meningitis
 the milder forms of infection om sinusitis are many times more common than the serious invasive forms of disease
 a face to face meeting will be arranged after the dose-ranging studies to make recommendations
hypotheses regarding bacterial co-colonisation will be tested using molecular techniques
 b new information regarding mucosal responses and bacterial colonisation with direct application to mucosal vaccine development
00ec586d591bfbe2f07a1322fe6501addac51798   pneumococcal disease is preceeded by colonisation of the nasopharynx of uninfected adults and children
 asymptomatic colonisation may be followed by carriage which remains asymptomatic or may rarely progress to disease
 most episodes of carriage result in improved immunity to future infection without the development of disease
 as such the mechanisms by which carriage is established the immunity that results from carriage and the mechanisms that determine when carriage ends are all of critical importance in the design of mucosal vaccines against pneumococcal disease
although there are many studies measuring natural pneumococcal carriage rates and serotypes in humans there are very limited data on the immune response to pneumococcal carriage in humans because the timing of any natural carriage episode is difficult to determine
 experimental human pneumococcal carriage has been safely established in two previous studies
 6 7 from these studies it is known that a variable proportion of those subjects inoculated with pneumococci become colonised
 the variables determining carriagenon-carriage following inoculation are unclear
 the rate of colonisation following nasal inoculation in these studies was reported as 50 with a duration of carriage between 21 and 122 days
 the immune response in nasal washings and serum showed an association between humoral responses to protein and polysaccharide antigens and carriage
 the humoral and cellular responses in the lung that result in response to nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage have not been described
murine studies have identified a number of pneumococcal proteins on the cell surface that induce antibodies in the host including pneumococcal surface protein a pspa pneumococcal surface adhesion a psaa and choline binding protein a cbpa also called pspc
 these proteins are common to the cell surface of all pneumococci
 in addition pneumolysin ply is a cytoplasmic protein also expressed by all pneumococci
 these surface and cytoplasmic proteins are both highly immunogenic and humoral responses confer protection against both invasive disease and carriage in mice 8 9 10 11 12 
 pre-existing antibody to cell wall polysaccharide has been demonstrated to be predictive of resistance to colonisation 6 7 
 susceptibility to carriage does not appear to correlate with pre-existing levels of immunoglobulin g igg to the specific capsular polysaccharide
 a rise in specific antibodies to protein cbpa and pspa during human carriage has also been demonstrated 6 7 
it has been demonstrated that mice lacking effective t-cell function have an increased duration of pneumococcal colonisation following inoculation suggesting that further examination of the cellular immune response to colonisation may provide useful information 13 
 mucosal t lymphocytes are critical in the regulation of mucosal defence
 recent data have emphasized the importance of both humoral responses and th17 subsets of cd4 lymphocytes in mucosal defence in murine model 14 15 
 our group has recently demonstated the upregulation of th17 lymphocytes in human lung following ehpc
 up-regulation of th17 antigen-specific cells is consistent with enhanced protection against pneumonia this could be tested in future by observing the association between th17 response and vaccine protection against a pneumococcal challenge
this study will address important current questions including dose dependency to establish pneumococcal carriage in human subjects the immune response in the lower airway to nasal carriage and innate humoral and cellular responses in both mucosal and systemic compartments
 we have previously demonstrated these responses to polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines 16 17 18 
 examination of individuals pre and post pneumococcal carriage and comparison between the immune response of colonised against un-colonised subjects will provide new information on the innate cellular and humoral immune responses to pneumococcal colonisation
 in future this model will be used in testing the effect of new candidate vaccines
 a major roadblock identified in the process of developing new protein vaccines has been a means of down-selecting from among the candidate antigen combinations proposed as vaccines -the ehpc model offers a means of doing just this by testing the effectiveness of candidate vaccines in blocking subsequent ehpc
we will carry out a dose-ranging study using 10 experimental carriage volunteers at each of 6 test doses and construct a dose-response curve b prospectively test the reproducibility and confidence interval associated with 50-80 carriage using lot quality assurance sampling lqas c vaccine effect testing
dose-ranging study -healthy volunteer adults will be screened to exclude subjects at risk of disease or subjects in contact with others at risk
 recruited volunteers will be screened for native pneumococcal carriage by nasal wash
 natural carriage volunteers will be excluded from inoculation but continue with the rest of the study as per experimental carriage volunteers
 120 experimental carriage subjects will then be recuited in groups of 10 subjects
 up to 40 natural carriage volunteers will be recruited
 each group of 10 experimental carriage subjects will be inoculated with 0
1ml pneumococci to each nostril
 the inoculated doses will be increased in each cohort of ten subjects from the initial cohort 1x10 4 cfunostril to 2x10 4  4x10 4  8x10 4  1
6x10 5  3
2x10 5 cfunostril
 we plan to recruit up to 20 participants to receive an inoculation of 0
9 saline solution to provide a control arm
 we will use the data to construct a graph of the carriage rate achieved with each inoculum dose
 the full dose ranging study will be done with serotype 6b and the repeated with serotype 23fboth of these types have been used in our pilot studies
the primary endpoint in each subject will be the detection of pneumococci by classical culture methods in nasal wash at 48hrs andor 7-10 days following inoculation
 the dose-response curve will then be used to tailor future vaccine assessment studies to purpose
 predicted 80 carriage will allow the ehpc model to have high sensitivity for vaccine efficacy with small study numbers
 the dose-response curve will also allow prediction of a 50 endpoint that will allow the combined testing for benefit and harm in future vaccine studies but at the cost of larger study numbers
the secondary endpoints are immunological assays to determine defence against infection
 we will collect samples in order to apply these assays to nasal wash saliva bronchoalveolar lavage urine throat swabs and blood before and after experimental challenge
 this will provide data on the density of colonisation as well as upper and lower airway innate humoral and cellular defence
 these data will allow us to define the host variables that predict ehpc reproducibility
 for example it may be that subjects with pre-existing high levels of anti-capsular igg or innate factors are resistant to ehpc and a future highly reproducible model may have to exclude these subjects at screening
reproducibility study -we will recruit 30 experimental carriage volunteers for each of the 2 serotypes
 a target carriage rate will be chosen from the dose ranging study and using the dose and protocol refined in that study simple reproducibility will be assessed by obtaining a confidence interval for the mean carriage
 using more complex data carriage density duration lqas 19 analysis can be applied
 lqas allows each sample to be defined as acceptable or unacceptable within a range of values and the hypothesis that the ratio of acceptableunacceptable is the same can be tested in the most parsimonious manner together with an estimate of the predictive value of this estimate
 lqas combines modelling with hypothesis testing and is directly applicable to the vaccine down-selection planned later
we will re-challenge volunteers successfully colonized in the reproducibility study with either the homologous or heterologous serotype using the same protocol re-challenge protocol to determine within serotype and across-serotype protection
 this is optional to the volunteer
we will inoculate natural carriers that were recruited during the study with the 6b strain to determine within serotype and across-serotype protection accounting for the previous natural serotype
 this will be performed according to the re-challenge protocol however this will include those volunteers that were previously removed from the study due to natural carriage
 the 2-6month interval will be counted from the termination of study in those that were previously removed from the study due to natural carriage or from completion of study in all other natural carriers
 this is optional to the volunteer
the study aims to investigate the innate acquired humoral and cellular immune response to induced pneumococcal nasal carriage in a safe and controlled manner
 we will carry out a dose-ranging study with type 6b and 23f pneumococci in order to find the optimal dose for 50-80 carriage with each serotype n10 experimental carriage subjects per dose range
 we will then test the hypothesis that we have achieved 50-80 carriage using lot quality assurance statistics in 2 prospective test sets n30 experimental carriage subjects per test set to ensure reproducibility
 we will re-challenge carriers with pneumococci to determine the protective effect of experimental human pneumococcal carriage ehpc itself as a surrogate for vaccine induced immunity
 we will describe the mechanisms underlying ehpc -protection from carriage
three major applications of this study are a as an immunological probe of mucosal immunity in the upper and lower airway b as a mucosal vaccine model and c as a potential surrogate of protection for testing novel protein vaccines with the eventual goal of a needle-free inhaled vaccine against s
 pneumoniae
we will inoculate healthy non-smoking adult volunteers with a well-characterised penicillin-sensitive pneumococcus 23f or 6b and observe the volunteers for the development of pneumococcal carriage
 colonisation may be expected to occur in 50-80 of the group while the remainder will clear the inoculum in a few hours

advertisements will be placed on physical notice boards in public areas and on the intranet of liverpool university and rlbuht as well as in the local press inviting healthy volunteers to participate
 interested persons are asked to contact the research team for further information and an initial appointment will be made should they wish to consider participating
adults aged 18-60 yrs -ages chosen to minimise the risk of pneumococcal infection unable to give fully informed consentclinical examination -the initial clinic visit will include a focused clinical history and targeted clinical examination involving auscultation of the lung fields and heart sounds
 should a previously unrecognised abnormality be identified this will be explained to the individual who will be informed they will be excluded from enrolling in the study and appropriate follow up and investigation will be arranged through the general practitioner
saliva samples -will be collected as per timetabled protocol above including the first clinic visit
 samples will be collected using salivates retained for 2 minutes between the gum and buccal mucosa as per the manufacturers instructions
nasal lavage -will be performed using a modified naclerio method 1 
 this is a well used and validated technique to collect nasal cytology specimens with which we now have 2 years experience
 briefly 10ml of saline is instilled and held for a few seconds in the nares before being expelled in to a petri dish
 in the event of nasal wash loss defined as coughsneezeswallow the procedure may then be repeated to obtain an adequate specimen
 should this initial wash demonstrate that a potential volunteer is already colonised with pneumococci they will follow the study but without inoculation
bloodvenous blood will be taken by an appropriately trained team member
 in the standard visits up to 40ml of blood will be collected for extraction of serum and whole blood an edta sample will be taken on the screening visit to determine normal range of white cell count
 in the enriched sample sets 2 paxgene tubes each 5ml will be collected on the additional days but the 40ml draw will only occur on the standard days
 volunteers will therefore give 40ml per week normally or 80ml in week 1 and 50 ml in week 2 in the enriched sampling
a viral throat swab will be obtained to assess viral load and viral co-infections in individuals who are colonised and not colonised following inoculation
 samples will be taken pre and 48 hours post pneumococcal inoculum to investigate the relationship between upper respiratory tract viral infections and susceptibility and density of pneumococcal colonisation
 in brief the individuals tongue will be depressed using a tongue depressor exposing the palatopharyngeal arch
 a sample will be obtained by making 5 small circular motions of the right palatopharyngeal in contact with the mucosa whilst avoiding the patients tongue
 the swab will be returned to the respective container and viral multiplex pcr will be used to evaluate the presence of flu a flu b rsv hmpv paraflus 1-4 adenovirus rhinovirus and coronaviruses oc43 229e nl63 and hku1
preparation of bacteria for carriage studies -mid-log broth culture of pneumococcus type 23f or 6b will be frozen at -80°c in aliquots of glycerol-enriched media
 frozen aliquots will be thawed and checked for cfuml e-test penicillin susceptibility and purity
 these checks will first be carried out in our laboratory and then identification and characterisation will be confirmed in a reference laboratory
 on experimental days aliquots will be thawed washed twice and re-suspended at an appropriate density for each inoculation dose
inoculation -using a p200 micropipette 0
1ml broth containing the desired dose ranging from 1x10 4 to 3
2x10 5 cfunostril of type 23f or 6b pneumococcus will be instilled
 patient will be seated in a semirecumbent position
 after inoculation patient will remain in this position for up to 15mins
 patient will be given post-inoculation advice sheet including emergency contact details thermometer amoxicillin and a daily symptom log to be completed by the participant
determination of colonisation -colonisation will be defined by the result of nasal washes taken at 48hrs and 7 days post inoculation
 nasal washes will be plated on to culture media and incubated overnight at 37°c in 5 co2
 colonies will be confirmed as s
 pneumoniae using classical techniques including i typical draughtsman-like colony morphology ii the presence of α-haemolysis iii optochin sensitivity ivsolubility in bile salts and v gram-positive diplococci
 typing by quellung reaction will be done using a typing kit with specific sera to confirm inoculated pneumococcal types
 isolates will be frozen at -80ºc for storage and reference laboratory confirmation
 results from the cultured nasal wash will also be confirmed using pcr based methods of bacterial detection
monitoring of colonisation -monitoring of colonisation will be done by weekly nasal washes reproducibility study
 home monitoring will include a symptom check-list with a clear flow chart of the necessary intervention should any symptoms develop see patient information sheet
 a three day course of amoxicillin will be issued on enrolment
 participants will be required to make text message contact with a specified member of the research team before 1400hrs every day until study completion
 should they not make contact by the specified time a member of the research team will contact the volunteer
 if no contact is made then a prior defined secondary contact will be telephoned
 during the post inoculation period volunteers will have access to a 247 on-call telephone service until after the end of the study
all study participants who are still carrying pneumococcus at the end of the study will take amoxicillin 500mg tds for 3 days orally at the end of the study
the study primary outcomes are carriage at 48 hours andor 7days in inoculated volunteers
 this will be determined by culture of the 48 hour -7 day nasal wash sample
secondary endpoints are immunological parameters and further bacterial carriage characterisation
 in particular innate humoral and cellular responses to pneumococcal proteins and polysaccharide measured in serum saliva nasal wash
soluble factors -serum saliva nasal wash supernatant and bal supernatant will be assayed for antimicrobial peptides such as slpi lysozyme lactoferrin ll-37 and beta defensins as well as neutrophil recruiting chemokines such as cxcl-1 2 and their receptors and cxcl-8 il-8 slpi
cellular responses -nasal washings saliva and bal will be examined by giemsa stained cytospin for recruitment of neutrophils
 in addition the number of macrophages and the apoptotic fraction of these macrophages will be determined if possible
 nb the cellular fraction of nasal wash is highly variable and many samples may have inadequate cellular material for analysis
 it may be possible to use transcriptomic techniques to examine cellular rna if whole cell analyses are not possible
humoral immunoglobulin specific levelsincluding anti-capsule and anti-protein pspa psaa pspc ply igg and iga will be examined by elisa as well as opsonophagocytic activity opa
 some immunoglobulin responses may alter adhesion or be anti-inflammatory
 we will collaborate with cdc atlanta to optimise ig response measurement using luminex hence parsimonious use of sample and then develop both adhesion and avidity assays to determine immunoglobulin function
differential cell counts will be performed by cytospin on all nasal washes and bal samples before and after pneumococcal carriage to confirm the absence of inflammation
 antigen specific cd4 t cell responses are critical in defence against pneumococcal carriage 2 in animal models
 we will determine these responses in nasal wash if possible above and bal samples using multi-parameter flow cytometry 4 
 in particular we will determine the cd4 th1th2 ratio and gate on memory cd4 t cells to examine the percentage of antigen specific cells against cell free supernatant from the pneumococcus culture broth
 a proliferation index cfse staining activation cd154 signal and cytokine profile ifn gamma il-4 tnf and il-2 of the specific cells can be determined to interrogate the functional quality of the responsive cells including regulatory t cell responses
 we will compare volunteers baseline and post-carriage observations to determine response to carriage
 we will then compare volunteers with carriage to non-carriage subjects to determine the type of t cell response that is associated with eradication of carriage
 cellular defence t cell proliferation by cfse intracellular cytokine staining following antigen stimulation will be measured in peripheral blood and bal if available
molecular techniques will be employed to determine the carriage density primers including lyta of pneumococcus and other nasopharyngeal and lower airway microbiota
 modern techniques include 16srdna typing deep sequencing with 454 technology and transcriptomic profiling in collaboration with liverpool university imperial college wt sanger institute u penn or univ nijmegen
 none of these methods are clinically validated and so we will use conventional techniques to determine the primary endpoint
 we will also characterise the dynamics of co-colonisation particularly of s
pneumoniae with staphylococci and haemophilus spp in collaboration with emory university
pneumococcus is responsible for infections including otitis media om sinusitis pneumonia bacteraemia and meningitis
 the milder forms of infection om sinusitis are many times more common than the serious invasive forms of disease
 while the risk to individuals of developing any infection is very low 10 adults experience colonisation at any time and the incidence of invasive disease is 20100 000 patient years the study is designed to ensure any risk is minimal by appropriate - the dmsc will receive a weekly update on all recruitment by email and will meet by telephone conference in the event of any adverse events
 a face to face meeting will be arranged after the dose-ranging studies to make recommendations
we have experience of over 1000 of these procedures and have published an audit of volunteer experience in the journal of medical ethics
 we have a full risk assessment that can be provided as separate documents but in summary we have had a low complication rate mild symptoms in less than 25 subjects and no serious adverse events
the primary endpoint of carriage will be plotted as a rate against dose and a dose-carriage plot used to predict 50 and 80 carriage if reached
 using a target carriage rate lqas methods will be used to test the confidence limits of the protocol in a reproducibility study
immunological parameters will all be compared against pre-exposure values where possible in paired analyses using parametric or non-parametric tests as appropriate
 in the case of bal data we will only have one sample and therefore and will test hypotheses against test values and by non-paired comparison between groups e
g
 carriersnon-carriers
 for example in current studies we know that the percentage of antigen-specific t cells does not exceed 1 in normal subjects in the absence of carriage
hypotheses regarding bacterial co-colonisation will be tested using molecular techniques
 these methods are inherently semi-quantitative and so evaluation will be by comparison of proportions in samples at different time points and between subject groups
 we will be advised by dr brian faragher and professor joe valadez in the complex analyses planned in this study
success in this project will result in a a robust ehpc protocol that can be used in novel vaccine evaluation
 b new information regarding mucosal responses and bacterial colonisation with direct application to mucosal vaccine development
 future work will be planned to build on both of these anticipated outcomes by engaging with vaccine manufacturing companies and mucosal adjuvant programmes

are you changing your approach to initial inductionthere is a controversy about the use of steroids a key part of induction therapy
if the physician considers that the patient is at high risk of complications we recommend a multidisciplinary discussion and  or with the coordinators of the protocol with a view to considering reductions in dose or in the number of administrations of certain drugs including potentially steroids
 once all the induction chemotherapy has been administered the use of g-csf in a covid  patient can be discussed to reduce the duration of neutropenia
the implementation of all or part of treatment on an outpatient basis must be carefully weighed
 indeed the comings and goings to the ambulatory clinic and blood samplings at home increase the number of contacts at risk

 duck-hee kang is an associate professor at the university of alabama at birmingham school of nursing birmingham alabama
 prapim buddhirakkul is a doctoral student and faculty of nursing this is an interesting and provocative paper
 lee and her international colleagues 1 clearly challenge other nurses and nurse researchers to take up a global perspective for exploring healthcare issues and join the force to improve the health of people across the nations
 the globalization of the world is a reality
 it is not a new concept
 while nurses form the cornerstone of the healthcare teams nurses have not taken a leadership role in global healthcare issues or in moving forward with active programs of international collaborative work and research
 international collaborations in healthcare research are particularly lacking between eastern and western countries
 only a handful of nurse researchers have begun to take an initiative in this venue
 similarities as well as differences in healthcare issues healthcare delivery systems environmental sociocultural and economical factors and health behaviors and health policies both at the population and individual levels for example can form a rich ground for mutual learning in solving common healthcare problems between the nations
 many healthcare issues are no longer an isolated problem confined to a certain nation or region of the world
 as the entire world is within one-day traveling distance a health problem in one region or nation can quickly spread to the other regions and nations in a very short time period
 a recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is a very good example of such healthcare crises that demand rapid and efficient solutions via active international collaborations
 beyond such unexpected and sporadic outbreaks of illnesses and diseases a more fundamental issue is how nurses and nurse researchers should think out-ofthe-box and out of the one-locality and one-nation mind set
 nurses need to think beyond the boundaries
working together across the nations should be a norm rather than an exception
 when and why does a certain healthcare system succeed or fail in a given nation or locality what lessons can we gain from each others trials and errors what are the major factors that may significantly influence public health in a given nation or region and how can nurses be involved in identifying overcoming and correcting any shortcomings to improve public health what role can nurses and nurse researchers play in improving global health care across the nations how can we adopt and remodel successful programs of health care from one nation to another to best serve target populations these are some basic questions nurses and nurse researchers should pursue
 health promotion disease prevention and health maintenance and restoration are a common goal for all human beings regardless of the origin of the race and the nation
 nurses and nurse researchers should take an active role in achieving these goals across the nations
 lee and colleagues 1 have taken an important initial step toward this goal by comparing the healthcare delivery systems and health outcomes between the two countries of korea and thailand
in a conceptual framework for globalization and health woodward et al 2 list several major constructs that influence the overall level and equity of health
 these constructs include the healthcare system national and personal economy health influences and risk factors at the population and individual levels along with other societal and political factors
 within the health care system the health care delivery system may drive the health service access health service quality and health service price
 as indicated in lee et als 1 article the two different healthcare delivery systems of korea and thailand with differential structural and resource allocation may lead to considerably different health outcomes
 despite similar demographic characteristics of the population between two countries and despite the fact that the gross national income is nearly 5 times higher for korea than for thailand the maternal and infant mortality rates are much higher in korea
 such success in thailand may be attributed to the healthcare delivery system built wisely and appropriately to serve people while keeping the health service price down
 as a clear example demonstrating the linkages between the health care delivery system and subsequent health outcomes it may be useful to further illustrate the thailand system in detail
the majority of people in thailand reside in rural areas where the traditional healthcare system may not sufficiently cover the cost of healthcare services for the poor
 the concept of primary health care was introduced in thailand over 2 decades ago interestingly modeled after a successful korean system developed to revitalize the pride and economy of every rural village in korea
 under this primary healthcare concept health care in thailand starts at the lowest village level
 when adequate care cannot be provided at that level then the sick seek the care at the next higher level of the care system moving from the village to subdistrict to district to provincial hospital level
 at the village level each village selects village health volunteers who can provide health information and basic care to their neighbors of 15-20 households
 these village health volunteers are trained and supervised by the technical nurses at the subdistrict health centers using the modules and manuals provided by the ministry of public health
 these modules and manuals are developed to fit the levels of village health volunteers for easy understanding and allow them to give their neighbors simple health information that is focused on nutrition sanitation maternal child health immunization mental health and so on
 this system is known as the grass root healthcare system in thailand
 the ministry of public health presents its continuous support by designating an annual national village health volunteer day and giving recognition to excellent village health volunteers
 placement of a midwife at each subdistrict health center is another example of making a difference in maternal and child health outcomes in thailand
this example highlights how systematic structures of a healthcare delivery system with specific targets on particular areas of health care can make a difference in health outcomes of the nation
 because the economy is a major interacting factor the healthcare delivery system needs to be built to increase health service access and quality while keeping the health service price down
 the effective mobilization and maintenance of the low cost healthcare system and easy access to healthcare services supported by the global national policy and structure might have been the keys to success demonstrated in thailand in lee et al
s article 1 
 more active healthcare research can be initiated at international levels by nurse researchers to explore effective means of improving public health across nations
 health out-comes however might also have been affected by several other factors beside the healthcare delivery system which have not been adequately addressed in lee et al
s article 1 perhaps largely due to the limitations in available databases
 one such salient factor affecting health outcomes is health behavior
health behaviors are a major determinant of health outcomes
 in woodard et al
s 2 globalization and health conceptualization health behaviors are conceptualized as an individual health risk factor that also can be influenced by socialcultural health influence at the population level
 as clearly illustrated in lee et al
s article 1 the high percentages of men smoking and drinking in korea are striking
 while the percentages of men smoking and drinking in thailand are not low the smoking rate is nearly double among korean men
 in contrast the percentage of men exercising in korea is a mere 9
9 approximately one third of the percentage of men exercising in thailand
 another clear concern is the considerable number of women drinking in korea
 although health outcome data are limited in specifics such as for the types of cancer mortality 1 the extent and duration of certain health behaviors and other confounding factors would have a major impact on various health outcomes
 this relationship is partly evidenced by the high mortality rate from cancer and cardiovascular diseases in koreans
there is an urgent need of further investigations
 nurses need to better understand the basis of such detrimental health behaviors in a particular sector of the world korean men in this case
 through international collaborations and communications the underlying reasons and potential strategies for interventions can be carefully explored
 detrimental health behaviors must be discouraged systematically while protective health behaviors need to be adopted at the national and individual levels
 lessons from other nations can ideally facilitate a more effective change process in another nation
 needless to say the strategies must be adopted to be socioculturally appropriate and economically sound for meeting the particular needs of a given nation
 however increased international collaborations and comparative analyses between and among nations on relevant health issues can substantially increase the efficiency and the likelihood of the success of the adopted programs
 further adopted programs must be implemented at the multidimensional levels targeting behavioral changes not only on the individual but also on the societal levels
in order for the programs to be successful it is also essential for nurses and nurse researchers to understand deeply embedded social cultures beforehand
 for example nurses must know that it is customary for a large proportion of korean men to eat dinner out with friends and colleagues after work nearly every weekday
 at the dinner table men smoke and share drinks
 in fact smoking and drinking are highly encouraged and pressure to conform to this behavior is common among members of the social groups
 for instance it is not polite for a man to refuse a drink or a cigarette when others particularly someone in higher power or a higher position offer such
 furthermore it is expected that those who receive the offer return the favor thus continuing a vicious cycle of more smoking and more drinking
 when such behavior largely constitutes male socialization and bonding those who do not smoke and drink tend to fall outside the social circle often feeling left out and isolated
 a positive note in such a seemingly destructive social culture is that this is an effective means for korean men to disperse their daily stress from a highly competitive society
 thus understanding cultural aspects is a critical step for any international collaboration
 in such a social climate it will be extremely difficult to change individuals behaviors without concurrent changes in the societal attitude and norm
 to this end national healthcare policy and societalcultural changes need to be planned over time using a step-by-step systematic approach to facilitate the success
negative health behaviors can result in direct economic consequences for the society
 kang et al
 3 estimated the economic burden of smoking in korea using two different approaches disease specific and all causes approaches
 based on the major data source of the korea medical insurance corporation cohort study the authors estimated the costs of smoking to range from 0
59 to 1
19 of gross domestic product equivalent to 4
89-9
86 million per 100000 people
 in addition to being an economic burden smoking in korea is found to be a major independent risk factor of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases even in a population that has relatively low levels of serum cholesterol
 4 fortunately however there is a recent movement for changes in smoking behaviors in korea
 because of increasing public awareness national policies are being implemented to curtail smoking in korea
 the smoking areas are clearly designated and separated from non-smoking areas in all public buildings and more strict regulations are expected in the near future to restrict smoking
 in contrast the rate of drinking both in men and women remains high in korea despite the high incidence rates of liver malignancies and diseases
 similarly exercise is another major health behavior that needs to be actively promoted and endorsed for beneficial effects on health outcomes
 although societal attitude has become much more enthusiastic about exercisephysical activity since the olympics in seoul korea in 1988 the society needs to embrace beneficial health behaviors more quickly and actively
 this is a clear national example that demonstrates how culture intersects with societal health behaviors that can have a significant impact on health outcomes
seeman and crimmins 5 discussed the effects of social environment on health
 major health behaviors known to impact various health outcomes such as smoking drinking exercise physical activity as well as dietnutrition need to be examined and compared across nations
 effective strategies for endorsing beneficial health behaviors can be implemented concurrently at the individual and population levels with adequate allocation of resources and infrastructures
 often history tends to repeat
 history in one nation can be a current reality in another nation
 through active international collaborations as demonstrated by lee et al 1 nurses and nurse researchers can make significant contributions to minimizing unnecessary repetition of an unsuccessful history by facilitating an adoption of effective strate-gies for changing health behaviors that are culturally appropriate
nurses and nurse researchers have a major role in public health promotion disease prevention and maintenance and restoration of health
 in particular nurses can make a significant impact on health promotion and disease prevention
 health education is an essential basic means of promoting health and preventing diseases
 through public education nurses can contribute to changing the health behaviors and self-care practices of the public
 the people in the community for example can be educated without delay when they need to seek healthcare
 appropriate care-seeking behaviors participation in screening and preventive measures and effective utilization of the healthcare system in turn are related to healthcare access
 as illustrated in lee et al
s 1 article the heathcare system in thailand seems to have been structured to facilitate easy access to healthcare by people in the community who are most likely underprivileged and poor
 by utilizing village health volunteers at the village level the thailand system seems to facilitate easy dissemination of basic health information and basic care to people in need thus making an impact on health promotion and disease prevention at an early stage
 in this regard technical nurses at the subdistrict level have the major responsibility of training these village health volunteers as the workforce in the frontline for health promotion and disease prevention
in the past technical nurses at health centers at the subdistrict level in thailand were graduates from a 2-year school of nursing sponsored by the ministry of public health
 most of these nurses receive scholarships from the ministry of public health and go back to work at health centers
 however more recently these technical nurses have been highly encouraged to continue their education to obtain a bachelors degree in nursing
 at the same time the ministry of public health is advocating that all of their schools of nursing be nursing and midwifery colleges to better prepare nurses at health centers to promote maternal child health and prevent diseases
 this bottom-up approach from the lowest healthcare level to the highest coincides with greater emphasis on the nurses role in health promotion and disease prevention which can make substantial differences in health outcomes that are evident in low maternal and infant mortality rates in thailand
 1 nursing curriculum at the same time should be organized to prepare nurses adequately for health promotion and disease prevention
the use of complementary and alternative medicine cam is common practice particularly in the orient which can affect health outcomes
 certain healing remedies are handed down across many generations as traditional medicine
 although there was a transient movement to discourage the use of cam a more recent approach in many nations is to better understand basic mechanisms underlying the anticipated effects of cam and accept the use of cam more openly and efficiently in conjunction with western medicine
 for example the thai government and the ministry of public health are now trying to incorporate the wisdom of thai traditional and alternative medicine into health care of thai people
 the institute of thai traditional medicine was established under the ministry of public health in 1993 httpwww
ittm
or
thengittm history
htm to further develop thai traditional medicine
 similarly the use of cam is prevalent in korea and the studies of oriental medicine have been well established in the university setting for decades
 commonly used cam includes thai and korean traditional medicine herbal medicine massage acupuncture acupressure and aromatherapy to name a few
 in western nations vitamins and dietary supplements are commonly used
 given the frequent use of cam by the public and their potential impact on health outcomes future studies should also utilize a more systematic approach for understanding the use of cam and their impact on health outcomes across nations
various factors such as the healthcare delivery system healthcare access quality cost and health behaviors have a major impact on health outcomes
 with globalization of the world nurses and nurse researchers need to take an active leadership role to promote health and prevent diseases across nations
 by enhanced international collaborations and comparisons nurses can make significant contributions to improving global health
 selected strategies for improving health however need to be carefully revised to be socioculturally and economically appropriate for the people of the target
 lee et al 1 clearly demonstrate the importance of further international collaborations for a common goal of health

 data on 57 studies with 221195 participants were used for analysis
 the authors assessed the heterogeneity of effect size using the q statistic and the i2 statistics
 subgroup and sensitivity analysis was done including the assessment of publication bias
 nevertheless the studys findings need to be confronted with a rigorous analysis of the data
 justification for inclusion of the study has been clearly stated and the suggested statistical analysis looks rigorous
 while the statistical methods are outlined and justified clearly just how the study was designed could be explained further
 it is noticeable however that majority of studies are from china alone in the pooled studies
 however overall the pooled estimate of the random effects model is heavily influenced by china
 the projected findings may be largely aimed at china
 the english language restriction of the search criteria is also a major limitation of the study findings
 this conclusion is not supported by data and it is a mere speculation
 they are also some inaccuracies in the text
 there are 195 countries in the world today
 therefore the number of 210 countries cited by the authors is not correct
 we all really appreciate your potential and optimism while you give such constructive and in-depth comments
 below we have written the point to point response to issues you raised
 reviewer comment 1 general this is an interesting effort but i believe the conclusion the authors make is wrong
 the prevalence of covid-19 in symptomatic subjects who present to the erget tested is higher in males
 gender differences in patients with covid-19 focus on severity and mortality
 2020 apr 298152 and dangis a et al
 impact of gender on extent of lung injury in covid-19
 the prevalence of covid-19 in symptomatic subjects who present to the erget tested is higher in males
 the prevalence of covid -19 among tested and confirmed patients is also higher in males
 this might be due to most tested patients are symptomatic and males are more likely to be symptomatic
 in addition roles and behaviors which increase the risk of acquiring covid-19 are more prevalent in male
 food or pharmacy manufacturing and sales agriculture or food production and distribution transportation and logistics and security
we have included such information in discussion part
 complete overhaul and resubmission could be considered

 reviewer comment in all the manuscript is compact and clear
 however there were several limitations affecting the strength of the results
 authors could consider province study quality and sample size et al
 as a result we extensively enriched the discussion part

 we have presented this findings in the manuscript page 7 line 126-140 table 2 reviewer comment 1
 in full-text review has the authors checked duplicate samples if so i suggest mentioned that in the paper
 author response the citation manager endnote version 4
2 automatically identifies duplicates among imported references which we had deleted
 we have explained these in the manuscript as per your comment
 result page 6 line 113-116 reviewer comment 2
 in results authors used term severe illness
 does that mean confirmed cases i thought it was easy to be mixed with critical ill case
 author response yes it was editorial mistake amended as per your comment page 7 line 124
 the description of how many individuals included in analysis and the definition of a covid-19 confirmed case are needed
 in presentation of publication bias i suggest author summarized the results from software rather than directly using the screen-capture
 in discussion the writing was too simple
 i suggest more explanation on how was the results supported by other findings e
 comment based on study quality author response we have re-write the discussion considering your and other reviewers comment
 we have tried to compare with other studies result finding
 to be frank we extensively enriched the discussion part

 reviewer comment the english language restriction of the search criteria is also a major limitation of the study findings
 this conclusion is not supported by data and it is a mere speculation
 authors response we have enriched the discussion by supporting our justification with dataprevious literatures in discussion
 this finding was also reported by other studies 9 10 
 a study in ontario canada showed that men were more likely to test positive 1 2 
 in pakistan 72 of covid-19 cases were male 11 
 food or pharmacy manufacturing and sales agriculture or food production and distribution transportation and security
 these increased levels of exposure makes males at high risk of acquiring covid-19 disease
4 times more likely than non-smokers to have severe symptoms of covid-19 12 
 men tended to develop more symptomatic and serious cases than women according to the clinical classification of severity
 women are in general able to mount a more vigorous immune response to infections and vaccinations 17 
 some previous studies on coronaviruses in mice have suggested that the hormone estrogen may have a protective role
 estrogens suppress the escalation phase of the immune response that leads to increased cytokine release 18 
 the x chromosome is known to contain the largest number of immune-related genes in the whole genome 15 
 thus womens immune systems are generally more responsive to infections
 thank you very much you have directed us a very important point regarding meta-regression
 univariate meta-regression analyses revealed that the prevalence of smoking was found to be high in males 
this contributed for high prevalence of covid-19 among males p0
021 and cardio vascular disease 0

 the paper investigates the sex difference in the prevalence of coronavirus disease confirmed cases during the 2020 pandemic of covid-19 using published literature from 2019 to 2020
 a systematic review of the published literature pubmed cochrane library and google scholar and a random effect metaanalysis model were used to pool the overall prevalence of covid-19 by gender
 data on 57 studies with 221195 participants were used for analysis
 the authors assessed the heterogeneity of effect size using the q statistic and the i2 statistics
 subgroup and sensitivity analysis was done including the assessment of publication bias
2
 the context is relevant the topic is extremely important as the outbreak of the pandemic of covid-19 constitute a health risk with economic impact on public health
 nevertheless the studys findings need to be confronted with a rigorous analysis of the data
major comments 4
 this is an important research topic and one that has potential to fill important knowledge gaps and contributes to the ongoing debate on the worldwide prevalence of the pandemic
 justification for inclusion of the study has been clearly stated and the suggested statistical analysis looks rigorous
 5 
 while the statistical methods are outlined and justified clearly just how the study was designed could be explained further
 it is noticeable however that majority of studies are from china alone in the pooled studies
 some thought has been given to conduct subgroup and sensitivity analysis eg sub-group by the study country and sample size
 however overall the pooled estimate of the random effects model is heavily influenced by china
 on the 57 studies only four studies are not from china coming from korea italy and japan with small sample size and the results run the risk of having only limited impact on policy and outcomes globally
 the projected findings may be largely aimed at china
 7 
 the english language restriction of the search criteria is also a major limitation of the study findings
 little effort was made by authors to consult other data sources and perhaps complement the published data with countries specific data worldwide
 for instance country specific data published by international organisations such who or ministry of health of specific countries or independent organisations httpswww
worldometers
infocoronaviruscoronavirus-age-sexdemographics could have been used to refine the estimates of the published data and to include more countries in the analysis
minor comments 8
 in the conclusion the authors argued that the male-female difference can be explained by hormonal and chromosomal variation between males and females and high prevalence of smoking and alcohol consumption among men
 this conclusion is not supported by data and it is a mere speculation
 the selected studies have this information a meta-regression analysis should be conducted to ascertain the effects of these factors on the prevalence
 9 
 they are also some inaccuracies in the text
 for instance page 4 line 58 the sentence reads so far 2019-ncov has affected more than 210 countries with 2 733591 confirmed cases…

 there are 195 countries in the world today
 this total comprises 193 countries that are member states of the united nations and 2 countries that are non-member observer states the holy see and the state of palestine
 therefore the number of 210 countries cited by the authors is not correct

infocoronaviruscoronavirus-age-sexdemographicsto reviewer 1 dear symons rolf reviewer we would like to forward our deep-seated gratitude for your interesting and valuable comments and helping us throughout the process
 we all really appreciate your potential and optimism while you give such constructive and in-depth comments
 since we have agreed with all of your points raised we believe we have amended the manuscript as per your comments
 we would like to thank you again since you are contributing for our better paper by giving such comments which is important to improve the quality of this paper
 below we have written the point to point response to issues you raised
 reviewer comment 1 general this is an interesting effort but i believe the conclusion the authors make is wrong
 the prevalence of covid-19 in symptomatic subjects who present to the erget tested is higher in males
 several studies have suggested a worse outcome for men with covid-19 and more extensive involvement on chest ct has been shown in males e
g
 jin jm et al
 gender differences in patients with covid-19 focus on severity and mortality
 frontiers in public health
 2020 apr 298152 and dangis a et al
 impact of gender on extent of lung injury in covid-19

 2020 apr 23
 the data the authors have does allow them to conclude covid-19 is more prevalent in symptomatic patients but as 90 of covid-19 subjects remains largely asymptomatic they cannot claim the prevalence of covid-19 is higher in males in general
 author response thank you very much dear for the resource you supplied and raised an interesting point regarding our conclusion
 the prevalence of covid-19 in symptomatic subjects who present to the erget tested is higher in males
 the prevalence of covid -19 among tested and confirmed patients is also higher in males
 this finding was also reported by other studies for instance a study in ontario canada showed that men were more likely to test positive and had higher rates of hospitalization icu admission and death 1 2 
 this might be due to most tested patients are symptomatic and males are more likely to be symptomatic
 in addition roles and behaviors which increase the risk of acquiring covid-19 are more prevalent in male
 male are more involved in different risky behaviors like alcohol consumption 3 4 5  key activities in burial rites as employees in basic sectors and occupations that continue being active and require them to work outside the home and interact with other people during the containment phase e
g
 food or pharmacy manufacturing and sales agriculture or food production and distribution transportation and logistics and security
 bc of such behaviors males mostly dont stay at home sit together remove their mask while they drink and smoke
 these increased levels of exposure makes males at high risk of acquiring covid-19 disease that is why it is more prevalent in male
 other literatures like global health 5050 data gathering the prevalence of covid-19 confirmed cases and the death rate due to covid-19 is high among males in different countries 6 7 8 
we have included such information in discussion part
 we have amended the conclusion as per your comment page 2 line 28 reviewer comment 2 background p337 sever - severe smoking and drinking alcohol reduce your overall health and therefore make you more susceptible to symptomatic covid-19 infection
 author response amended as per your comment page 10 line 2020-209 reviewer comment to conclude the effort is good but the conclusions are wrong
 complete overhaul and resubmission could be considered
 author response thank you very much again since we have extensively amended the paper to make it better than its previous submission because of you
to reviewer 2 dear weizhi liu reviewer we would like to forward our deep-seated gratitude for your interesting and valuable comments and helping us throughout the process
 we all really appreciate your potential and optimism while you give such constructive and in-depth comments
 since we have agreed with all of your points raised we believe we have amended the manuscript as per your comments
 we would like to thank you again since you are contributing for our better paper by giving such comments which is important to improve the quality of this paper
 below we have written the point to point response to issues you raised
 reviewer comment in all the manuscript is compact and clear
 it draws an important issue considering the sex difference in covid-19 pandemic which is critical reference for future polices and interventions
 however there were several limitations affecting the strength of the results
 there are mainly two concerns from my view lack of chinese database as mentioned in limitations i suggest collaborating with chinese scholars and inadequate analysis of source of heterogeneity since most of studies was in china subgroup by country was not enough
 authors could consider province study quality and sample size et al

 other comments are as follows author response we have consulted chines e scholar to the database and we used the data we get to compare our result in discussion part
 as a result we extensively enriched the discussion part
 thank you very much after your direction we have made subgroup analysis by province study quality and sample size and we found the pooled prevalence of covid- 19 supplementary fig 2

 in full-text review has the authors checked duplicate samples if so i suggest mentioned that in the paper
 author response the citation manager endnote version 4

 does that mean confirmed cases i thought it was easy to be mixed with critical ill case
 author response yes it was editorial mistake amended as per your comment page 7 line 124
 reviewer comment 3
 the description of how many individuals included in analysis and the definition of a covid-19 confirmed case are needed
 author response • 57 studies with a total of 221195 patients were included in the analysis page 6 line 113 • we have also included the case definitions of covid-19 confirmed case detection of sars-cov-2 nucleic acid in a clinical specimen  possible case any person with at least one of the following symptoms  cough fever shortness of breath sudden onset of anosmia ageusia or dysgeusia probable case any person with at least one of the following symptoms  cough fever shortness of breath sudden onset of anosmia ageusia or dysgeusia with close contact with a confirmed covid-19 case in the 14 days prior to onset of symptom or having been a resident or a staff member in the 14 days prior to onset of symptoms in a residential institution for vulnerable people where ongoing covid-19 transmission has been confirmed page 5 line 96-101

 in presentation of publication bias i suggest author summarized the results from software rather than directly using the screen-capture
 author response we have summarized the publication bias result in text and removed the picture from the software and amended as per your comment page 8 line 147-148
 reviewer comment 6
 in discussion the writing was too simple
 i suggest more explanation on how was the results supported by other findings e
g
 comparisons with the results from other studies how did sex chromosomes influence the process of getting infectious disease what were possible source of bias e

 i have the following queries and suggestions major comments reviewer comment  this is an important research topic and one that has potential to fill important knowledge gaps and contributes to the ongoing debate on the worldwide prevalence of the pandemic
 justification for inclusion of the study has been clearly stated and the suggested statistical analysis looks rigorous
 while the statistical methods are outlined and justified clearly just how the study was designed could be explained further

 the projected findings may be largely aimed at china
authors response yes you are correct due to lack of published papers from other countries at the beginning most of the published articles were from china
 in addition to assess the impact of sample size study quality and province we further conducted subgroup analysis by province sample size and study quality as we also directed by other revewers in addition to your concern
 thank you very much after your direction we have made subgroup analysis by province study quality and sample size and we found table 2 and supplementary fig 2

 we have presented this findings in the manuscript page 7 line 126-140 table 2  supplementary  figure 123 and 4  we have tried to discuss our result with other countries finding which were not included in to the analysis because of not fulfilling the inclusion criteria or due to quality appraisal process
 we have included this in limitation of the study as the pooled estimate may be influenced by china
 reviewer comment the english language restriction of the search criteria is also a major limitation of the study findings
 little effort was made by authors to consult other data sources and perhaps complement the published data with countries specific data worldwide
 for instance country specific data published by international organizations such who or ministry of health of specific countries or independent organizations httpswww
worldometers
infocoronaviruscoronavirus-age-sexdemographics could have been used to refine the estimates of the published data and to include more countries in the analysis
 authors response using only papers published in english were also our drawback that we included in limitation of the study
 however as you directed as we have used the country specific data published by international organizations such who or ministry of health of specific countries or independent organizations to compare and discus our result
 however those finding doesnt fulfill the quality appraisal checklist mainly because they lack a detail methodology which the appraisal checklist requires
 as a result we didnt include such findings in the pooled result rather we synthesize and discus this results considering your comment
 reviewer comment 8 in the conclusion the authors argued that the male-female difference can be explained by hormonal and chromosomal variation between males and females and high prevalence of smoking and alcohol consumption among men
 this conclusion is not supported by data and it is a mere speculation
 the selected studies have this information a meta-regression analysis should be conducted to ascertain the effects of these factors on the prevalence
 authors response we have enriched the discussion by supporting our justification with dataprevious literatures in discussion
 this finding was also reported by other studies 9 10 
 a study in ontario canada showed that men were more likely to test positive 1 2 
 in pakistan 72 of covid-19 cases were male 11 
 according to global health 5050 data gathering the number of covid-19 confirmed cases and the death rate due to covid-19 is high among males in different countries 6 7 8 
 this might be due to behavioral factors and roles which increase the risk of acquiring covid-19 tend to occur more among men
 male are more involved in different risky behaviors like alcohol consumption 3 4 5  key activities in burial rites as employees in basic sectors and occupations that continue being active and require them to work outside the home and interact with other people during the containment phase e
g
 food or pharmacy manufacturing and sales agriculture or food production and distribution transportation and security
 because of such behaviors males mostly dont stay at home sit together and remove their mask while they drink and smoke
 these increased levels of exposure makes males at high risk of acquiring covid-19 disease
 in china 50 of men in smoke but because it is not considered acceptable for women to smoke only 2 of them do so
smoking is associated with adverse outcomes of covid-19 for instance the combined results of five studies showed that smokers were 1
4 times more likely than non-smokers to have severe symptoms of covid-19 12 
 besides smoking is related to higher expression of ace2 the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 which might be the reason for the higher prevalence of covid-19 in this subgroup of patients than in women 13 
 men tended to develop more symptomatic and serious cases than women according to the clinical classification of severity
 similar occasions occurred during previous coronavirus epidemics men had worse outcomes of illness from severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 14 and a higher risk of dying from middle east respiratory syndrome mers 15 
 biological sex variation is said to be one of the reason for the sex discrepancy of covid-19 cases severity and mortality 16 
 women are in general able to mount a more vigorous immune response to infections and vaccinations 17 
 some previous studies on coronaviruses in mice have suggested that the hormone estrogen may have a protective role
 estrogens suppress the escalation phase of the immune response that leads to increased cytokine release 18 
 the authors showed that female mice treated with an estrogen receptor antagonist died at close to the same rate as the male mice 19 
 the x chromosome is known to contain the largest number of immune-related genes in the whole genome 15 
 with their xx chromosome women have a double copy of key immune genes compared to the single copy in xy men
 this boost extends to both the general reaction to infection the innate response and also to the more specific response to microbes including antibody formation adaptive immunity 15 
 thus womens immune systems are generally more responsive to infections
 this might mean women are able to tackle the novel coronavirus more effectively but this has not yet been proven
 thank you very much you have directed us a very important point regarding meta-regression
 we have run meta-regression to asses the effects of factors on the pooled prevalence and we found the following result
 univariate meta-regression analyses revealed that the prevalence of smoking was found to be high in males 
this contributed for high prevalence of covid-19 among males p0
002
 comorbidities like hypertension 0
042 diabetic mellitus 0
012 chronic respiratory disease 0
021 and cardio vascular disease 0
001 were also found to be higher in males and these significantly increases the prevalence of covid-19
 besides higher proportion of severcritical illness 0
003 and death 0
001 were also observed among males table 3 
 page 8 line 150-154 reviewer comment 9 they are also some inaccuracies in the text
 for instance page 4 line 58 the sentence reads so far 2019-ncov has affected more than 210 countries with 2 733591 confirmed cases




 there are 195 countries in the world today

 governor of delhi has notified the delhi epidemic diseases covid-19 regulations 2020 in new delhi where all hospitals to have flu corners to test for suspect cases history of travelling to be recorded and right to impose home or institution are the important silent features
 on the other hand all the states of india applied the notification in which academic institutes will be closed until the next notification
 similarly the government and private companies have asked their employees to work from home due to novel pandemic issue
 the prime minister of india narendra modi announced a 21-day nationwide curfewlockdown to minimize the impact of novel coronavirus as he requested to indian citizens with folded hands to practise strict social distancing
to reduce the impact of novel coronavirus and its transmission lockdown activities launched in whole country with restriction of human mobility and economic activities
 however to observe comprehensive air quality data in different places of india it can be seen that these novel coronavirus disease countermeasures led to remarkable improvement in the concentration of air pollutants https aqicn 
orgmapindia 
 according to who 2018 4
2 million premature deaths were reported in the year of 2016 due to ambient air pollution
 so as per the air quality index is concerned the enhancement in air quality of india now would significantly avert premature deaths due to air pollution on monthlyannually basis
in india many studies indicated that the transportation and movement of respiratory diseases depend on seasonal variation humbal et al
 2018 humbal et al
  2019 humbal et al
  2020 
 in this regard we might expect that the effects of novel coronavirus will be decreased with higher temperature in summer due to reduction in intrinsic transmissibility of the novel virus gautam and trivedi 2020 jung et al
 2009 
 moreover ma et al
 2020 conducted the first study to identify the significant effects of meteorological parameters i
e
 temperature and relative humidity on daily mortality due to covid-19 in china
 this study clearly mentioned that the daily mortality of covid-19 is positively and negatively associated with temperature and relative humidity respectively
 it can be concluded that the warmer season higher temperature during next few months and lockdown activities will be key to reduce the exposure to novel coronavirus on humans
 close monitoring and real time data will be benefitted to predict and make sound public health decisions
 the world must prepare for the possibility that mitigation measures might fail because most of the countries are taking too much time to prevent or delay the spread of covid-19
 for example sars infects very small proportion of people around the world however many people will still become critically ill and need a better treatment or icu care
 the icu departments should be developed in advance with rapid diagnosis and isolation clinical management and infection prevention to control the incremental patients and optimize workflows
 to prepare for a substantial increase in critical care bed capacity three working bodies i
e
 state-national governments hospital authorities and decisionpolicy makers must come together and work with icu practitioners
 scientistsprofessorresearchers have to address the important questions-what remains a poorly understood disease
 the focus on high-quality research work real time data practices based on real evidences data availability based on open access ethical integration in the point of extraordinary challenges and collaboration with chain like local to national and national to international will be important key factors to the success of this hard work

 the predominant viral pathogens affecting the adult cattle population in this country are foot-andmouth disease virus fmdv bovine herpesvirus-1 bhv-1 bovine leukaemia virus blv bovine rotavirus brv bovine viral diarrhoea virus tvdv parainfluenza-3 pi-3 and bovine coronavirus bcv
 infections with bovine enterovirus and adenovirus have also been detected zoratti de verona et al 1979  lager et al 1981  schudel et al 1984 
 in this paper the results of a serological survey of fetuses used for primary tissue culture preparation at the institute of e
 l
 weber and a
 a
 schudel are members of the consejo nacional de investigaciones cientificas y tecnicas virology inta-castelar are presented
 antibodies against fmdv pi-3 bhv-1 bvdv brv blv and bey were investigated using conventional techniques
a total of 315 fetuses from different regions of argentina were obtained at a local abattoir in buenos aires between august 1990 and april 1991
 blood samples were collected by heart puncture and sera were separated fractionated and stored at -20°c until assayed
 the fetuses were randomly selected and belonged to several european breeds
 they were classified according to sex and age -following the crownrump length method -as belonging to the first second or third trimester of gestation 0 to 3 4 to 6 7 to 9 months respectively
 most of the samples 55
9 per cent 176 sera belonged to the second trimester 30
8 per cent 97 sera to the third and 13
3 per cent 42 sera to the first
 viral antigens were propagated in primary or secondary fetal bovine testis cultures
 ma-104 bhk and hrt-18 cell lines were used for brv assays and preparation of fmdv and bcv antigens respectively
 the viral strains used were fmdv 01 campos bvdv oregon c-24 v bhv-i los angeles brv serotype 6 lincoln a bey strain obtained from s
 mcnulty veterinary research laboratories belfast and a field isolate of pi-3
antibodies against bvdv bhv-i fmdv and bcv were detected by indirect immunofluorescence m
 bovine rotavirus antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa and confirmed by 1if
 the authors found the iif more reliable since the positive samples had an elisa reading close to the cut-off value but were clearly positive by iif
 the haemagglutination inhibition 0ji method was employed for detection of anti-pi-3 antibodies
 to rule out the presence of non-specific haemagglutination inhibitors the positive samples were treated with neuraminidase and the hi assay was repeated
 blv antibodies were investigated by radial immunodiffusion
 antigen and positive control serum for this assay were kindly provided by the school of veterinary medicine university of la plata buenos aires
the results are shown in table 1 
 twenty-four sera were positive for antibodies against bvdv bhv-1 brv bcv or pi-3
 one of the samples had antibodies against both bhv-1 and bvdv
 no positives for fmdv or blv antibodies were detected
 non-specific inhibitors of the haemagglutination were also detected
 as expected positive samples were from fetuses in the second and third trimester which are fully able to synthesise immnnoglobulins schultz 1973 
 the prevalence of bvdv antibodies was 2-03 per cent four of 197 this is equivalent to the prevalence found in the usa in 1973 when a study involving 147 fetuses showed three to be seropositives hubbert et al 1973 
 however a recent report described that 13
9 per cent of 1608 pools of fetal sera from that country had bvdv antibodies
 each pool included sera from two to three fetuses and the percentage of seropositive fetuses would therefore be at least 4
6 per cent bolin et al 1991 
 the different values may reflect a current greater activity of the virus in the field or be a result of the application of modified live vaccines against bvdv
 in argentina vaccination is limited and carried out only with inactivated virus and fetal antibodies are elicited by a natural infection with wild type strains
antibodies against bhv-1 the agent of infectious bovine rhinotracheitisinfectious pustular vulvovaginitis were detected in 1
21 per cent of the samples two of 165
 a high percentage of cattle in argentina is infected with bhv-1 and viral isolations are common in diagnostic laboratories rodriguez et al 1989  therefore fetal antibodies are not unexpected
 the fetuses were seven and eight months old one of them also had bvdv antibodies table 1 
 using an inactivated virus kendrick and osburn 1973 showed that fetuses 100 days old are able to develop bhv-1 antibodies
 however the lethality of virulent strains of bhv-1 for fetuses younger than six months prevents the development of antibodies  wyler et al 1989 
the present results allow for an estimation of the probability of reproductive losses caused by bvdv and bhv-1 which are highly abortigenic kendrick 1971  wyler et al 1989 
 in addition bvdv may establish persistent infections in the fetus during the first 120 days of gestation brownlie 1990 
 assuming that the rate of fetal infection with either virus during the first trimester of pregnancy equals that of the second and third trimesters given by the prevalence of antibodies table  1  the chances of abortion due to bhv-i would be at least 1 per cent and the chances of abortion or births of calves persistently infected with bviv would be around 2 per cent
reported figures analysing bhv-1 and bvdv as causes of bovine abortions differ 2-9 per cent and 0
5 per cent of more than 3800 bovine abortions were caused by bhv-1 and bvdv respectively in the usa hubbert et al 1973  in britain lucas et al 1986 detected bvdv in 2
4 per cent of the 330 aborted fetuses analysed with 4 per cent of bvdv antibodies in fetal fluids and no bhv-1 antibodies or antigen
 in australia bvdv was detected in 2 per cent of 265 aborted fetuses jerrett et al 1984 
 in argentina abortions attributable to both agents occur  campero et al 1991  but no studies of a large number of cases have been made
 since the present samples were taken at random and originated in different herds from different regions the gross estimation of fetal losses induced by bhv-t or bvdv might be quite accurate
the authors can also estimate the probability of births of calves with central nervous system lesions induced by bvdv because infected fetuses 90 to 150 days old are prone to develop such lesions roeder et al 1986 
 the prevalence of bvdv antibodies in two fetuses four months old two of 197 table 1 indicates that roughly 1 per cent of the calves may be born with these lesions
five of 205 fetuses 2
44 per cent were positive for brv antibodies and five of 110 4
54 per cent were positive for bcv antibodies
 these are enteric viruses for which no viraemia has been described for this reason the finding of antibodies was unexpected
 however there is at least one report describing the detection of antibodies against these agents in fetal and precolostral serum samples in japan using the hi and neutralisation tests sato et al 1980 
 for brv antibodies the present authors employed an elisa and the iif test for confirmation
 as it was possible that the sera contained some non-specific factors able to bind to bay antigens denatured by the fixation procedures in these assays a seroneutralisation test against 1000 tcid50 of bovine rotavirus serotype 6 was conducted not shown
 partial neutralisation occurred demonstrating binding of the sera to the native proteins in the virion
 the possibility exists and should be investigated of the antibodies being against a different serotype of rotavirus as shown by briissow et al 1991  or that sera contain non-anti-body factors which partially neutralise the virus tokuhisa et al 1981 
for the detection of the brv and bcv antibody the percentage of seropositives found was considerably lower than that detected in japan
 tokuhisa et al 1981 detected non-specific virus-binding factors able to neutralise these viruses
 the differences in prevalence observed may be due to an authentic lesser proportion of infected fetuses to the absence of those factors in the samples used or to a greater specificity of the iif assay employed
pi-3 antibodies were detected in nine of 177 samples 5
08 per cent
 although most authors were not able to detect anti-pi-3 antibodies in fetal sera homer et al 1973  hubbert et al 1973  this was the highest prevalence in the present survey
 by treatment of the samples with neuraminidase the authors detected non-specific inhibitors of haemagglutination in 14
68 per cent of the samples as did homer et al 1973 
 the inhibitors were found exclusively in the oldest sera and the authors assume that they were derived from the denaturing of sera during storage
 although in argentina most of the adult bovine population are seropositive against pi-3 and the dams are usually immune not allowing the virus to reach the fetus the detected seroprevalence is comparatively high
 the fetopathic properties of pi-3 under field conditions are not clear but the virus can be recovered from aborted fetuses lucas et al 1986 and hi antibodies have been detected in fetal fluids and sera from aborted fetuses schultz 1973  jerrett et al 1984 
 no conclusive data are available and whether fetuses infected with pi-3 especially during the first trimester will be aborted remains an open question
the present authors did not detect fmdv or blv antibodies
 since fmdv is endemic in most of argentina the negative results in the search for fmdv antibodies and fmdv isolation attempts in fetal organs not shown supported the hypothesis that the virus was unable to pass the placental barrier schudel and sadir 1986 
in argentina blv antibodies can be detected both in adult cattle and in precolostral sera by the immunodiffusion assay employed
 the negative results can be explained by the low number of samples studied
 the percentage of seropositive samples in infected herds is relatively low 3 to 6 per cet of the infected dams toma et al 1990 and it is probable that the analysis of a greater number of sera would give some positive results
since only fetuses older than four months are able to produce an antibody response and some viral agents induce abortions viral infections of fetuses in the first trimester of gestation are easily missed unless viral isolations are attempted
 the analysis of the seroprevalence is only a first approach to the study of fetal infections but the results emphasise the need for prophylactic measures and routine controls of diagnostic and pharmaceutical reagents derived from fetal bovine tissues

abstract
death certification requires the same effort and dedication as all reports by doctors during their patients lifetimes
 the physician must follow the basic instructions to complete a death certificate correctly taking special care to fill in the sequence of causes of death
 in the case of a pandemic completion of the death certificate falls to the primary care physician and therefore the official bodies must publish instructions based on international recommendations
 it should be established as soon as possible whether it is possible to report deaths telematically
 while this is not possible in a pandemic procedures should be put in place to enable the immediate reporting of deaths to the health authorities
keywords death certificate pandemic mortality covid-19el conocimiento documentado de la propia historia social y de los individuos que la conforman es característico de las culturas desarrolladas
 uno de los factores que influyen en ese conocimiento social es la existencia de registros
 los registros de nacimiento y de defunción son buenos instrumentos para conocer nuestra historia social
 en españa encontramos documentos de registros de este tipo que datan del siglo xvi preservados en las parroquias junto con las partidas de bautismo
 con el tiempo la inscripción se hizo también al margen de las iglesias
 fue el estado de massachusetts el primer lugar en mantener registros de defunción en los tribunales de justicia 1639 1
 la certificación médica de defunción apareció en el último tercio del siglo xix por varios motivos
por un lado la mayor proximidad asistencial del médico al moribundo en el ámbito urbano junto con la fundamentación científica de la higiene pública que en gran parte se apoyó en el desarrollo de la estadística sanitaria y de la prevención pública
 esto también dio lugar a nuevas legislaciones y códigos civiles y al origen de los registros civiles
 además la incorporación de la estadística sanitaria llevó a la internacionalización de la prevención de la enfermedad
 a fines del siglo xix casi todos los países europeos tenían sistemas centralizados de registros de mortalidad
en 1871 tras varios intentos se logró la puesta en marcha del registro civil rc en españa 2 
este avance vino precedido por un periodo de transición que supuso la implantación de un j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f registro parcial provincial para grandes y medianas poblaciones en el año 1841
 la ley exigía a todos los municipios la creación de un rc en el que se debían inscribir los datos referentes al estado civil de todos los españoles nacimientos matrimonios defunciones etc
 al margen de sus creencias
 un siglo más tarde en 1957 se constató la necesidad de actualizar y renovar la ley entonces vigente adaptándola a las necesidades de la época dando lugar a la ley de 8 de según el reglamento que desarrolla la ley del rc debe cumplimentar el cmd-bed el facultativo que haya asistido al difunto en su última enfermedad o cualquier otro que reconozca el cadáver 7
 el código de deontología médica cd 8 regula el compromiso de certificar la muerte señalando que aunque el médico que haya tenido la mayor carga asistencial sobre el paciente es el que tiene la mayor responsabilidad ética de cumplimentar el certificado de defunción en todos sus apartados no es deontológicamente aceptable rehuir el compromiso de certificarla cuando se produce si se ha presenciado la misma se conoce al paciente o se tiene a disposición la historia clínica
 en el reverso del primer impreso del cmd-bed encontramos unas instrucciones básicas de certificación figura 1 que establece la oms para seguir a la hora de cumplimentar el certificado
 cuando se trata de muertes violentas o sospechosas de criminalidad no procede la firma del cmd-bed derivándose estas muertes a investigación judicial 9 
 el procedimiento general de manejo y notificación de los fallecimientos se recoge en la figura 2
el cmd-bed es un documento médico-legal en el que el profesional debe poner el mismo esfuerzo y dedicación que en el resto de los informes elaborados en vida del paciente
 clínica y éticamente se puede firmar un certificado con criterios de presunción si el desenlace es posible y hay compatibilidad entre la información sobre las circunstancias del fallecimiento y su patobiografía no siendo aceptable en cambio no firmarlo escudándose en un posible delito de falsedad que recoge el código penal
 en nuestra experiencia y la de otros autores se confirma que difícilmente se perseguirá a un médico que de buena fe y previa exploración del paciente certifique como natural una muerte que no lo sea 10 siendo un deber ético la cumplimentación del cmd-bed
 en esta situación se prioriza el ahorro de sufrimiento a los familiares por delante de las dudas legales no razonables humanizando el trato en unas circunstancias de padecimiento emocional tan intensas 11 
desde su publicación en 2009 el cmd-bed ha sufrido alguna modificación
 en la primera versión del cmd-bed las hoy llamadas causas intermedias se denominaban también causas antecedentes
 tras menos de dos años el ine comprobó que se estaba cumplimentando equivocadamente dicha variable y elaboró un documento que hizo llegar a los médicos a través de los cm 12
 en él se recogía que muchos médicos han interpretado este campo como antecedentes clínicos y no como debería entenderse es decir anotar en las llamadas causas antecedentes aquellos procesos que siendo debidos a la causa inicial produjeron la causa inmediata de muerte
 recientemente se han modificado incorporando código qr y recogiendo el número de colegiación de nueve cifras estableciendo las casillas de forma independiente para su adecuada cumplimentación
la correcta cumplimentación del cmd-bed tiene importantes consecuencias desde el punto de vista de política sanitaria
 en base a ellos el ine extrae de estos documentos las causas de defunción con los que genera las estadísticas oficiales de mortalidad
 según los resultados obtenidos se toman medidas de prevención y se destinarán los recursos necesarios para afrontar las necesidades existentes mediante la implementación de políticas sanitarias
 no cumplimentar adecuadamente las causas de muerte figura 3 puede tener una gran importancia desde el punto de vista epidemiológico 13 derivando como consecuencia de esto en una mala organización de los recursos destinados a la salud tanto en la investigación de enfermedades como en la implantación de políticas preventivas
j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f existe poca experiencia en nuestro medio en relación a la certificación de fallecimientos durante las epidemias
 se entiende que si se producen múltiples fallecimientos los procedimientos de actuación podrían ser semejantes a los de situaciones de catástrofe
 como sostienen barbería et al 14 las catástrofes constituyen un problema de salud pública al ser susceptibles de incrementar la morbilidad y mortalidad y disminuir la calidad de vida
 las epidemias cumplen evidentemente estas condiciones
 el papel de la certificación de las causas de la muerte en el caso de grandes catástrofes corresponde a la medicina forense 15 y el de la certificación en epidemias corresponde a la medicina asistencial 16 pero la comparación puede ser útil en el establecimiento de procedimientos para el manejo de cadáveres y la certificación de la muerte en casos de múltiples fallecimientos en epidemias 17 
quizá el único ejemplo que tenemos en españa de epidemias con múltiples fallecimientos y con registros de los mismos es la pandemia de gripe de 1918
 su estallido generó múltiples estudios científicos análisis estadísticos y una fuerte reacción de la prensa a partir de mayo de 1918
 fue una experiencia terrible para la sociedad que generó múltiples medidas para combatirla por parte de los gobiernos y respuestas extraordinarias por parte de los profesionales de la salud y de la población en general
 los estudios sobre la pandemia de gripe de 1918 han comprendido no sólo el análisis de los datos de morbi-mortalidad que son muy importantes en si mismos sino que también ha llevado a una comprensión de la epidemia más allá de las cifras
para poder evaluar las repercusiones que la epidemia tuvo sobre la mortalidad contamos con la información contenida en los movimientos naturales de población elaborados por el ine y con los boletines mensuales de demografía sanitaria que confeccionaba el ministerio de la gobernación
 estos datos sin embargo son insuficientes para descender a detalles
 por ejemplo los relacionados con los distritos de las ciudades
 porras 18 ha estudiado la estadística demográfica que confeccionaba anualmente el servicio de estadística del ayuntamiento de madrid así como los resúmenes generales anuales de esas estadísticas demográficas
 el cruce de esos datos con los fondos del rc y los libros de defunción correspondientes a los años 1918 y 1919 ha permitido determinar con detalle la evolución de la morbi-mortalidad de la pandemia en españa 19 
sin embargo ayer como hoy las cifras de mortalidad cambiaban según los criterios que se aplicaban así por ejemplo en el caso de madrid las tasas brutas de mortalidad general y específica de 1918 y 1919 que se obtenían a partir de los datos del rc y de los resúmenes generales anuales de las estadísticas demográficas del ayuntamiento de madrid eran muy diferentes ya que civilmente las muertes se consignaron en el distrito correspondiente a su j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f lugar de fallecimiento mientras que el ayuntamiento elaboró sus estadísticas a partir de los datos de los cementerios donde las muertes se anotaban en el distrito en el que se residía y no en el que se moría
 es un ejemplo de la complejidad de los estudios de morbimortalidad históricos 18 20 recomendaciones nacionales e internacionales sobre la certificación médica de la defunción en relación al covid-19
el 29 de marzo de 2020 el cgcom emitió un comunicado en el que de acuerdo con las definiciones propuestas por la oms la vocalía nacional de administraciones públicas informaba acerca del procedimiento a seguir en la certificación de las defunciones durante la actual epidemia de covid-19 16 
 el documento señala que las muertes producidas en una epidemia son muertes naturales
 no hace falta comunicar al ámbito médico-legal o judicial el fallecimiento
 la intervención judicial del médico forense se limitará a los casos de muerte violenta o en los que exista clara sospecha de criminalidad
 en esos casos en los que la investigación de la muerte corresponde al ámbito medico-legal el hecho de presentar una pcr sars-cov-2 positiva indica un dato de interés epidemiológico que quizá deba tenerse en cuenta como factor agravante si la muerte se produce de forma diferida al hecho traumático pero esa posible concausa corresponde analizarla al profesional forense
 en el resto de los casos la certificación de la muerte corresponde a los médicos asistenciales con independencia de que trabajen en un ámbito público o privado en la misma línea de lo recogido en otros países de nuestro entorno 21 22 
 si previamente señalábamos que ante el fallecimiento de una persona se debe priorizar el ahorro de sufrimiento a los familiares por delante de las dudas legales no razonables a la hora de la certificación humanizando el trato en unas circunstancias de padecimiento emocional tan intensas 11  en circunstancias como las vividas en esta pandemia este principio se hace mas necesario que nunca
el documento del cgcom establecía dos escenarios a la hora de certificar muertes covid-19
 el primero se refería a aquellos en los que no existe confirmación analítica pero hay clínica compatible con la enfermedad
 en estas circunstancias se recomendaba certificar como covid-19 no confirmado o sospecha de infección por coronavirus como causa fundamental
 y como causa inmediata se proponía usar fallo multiorgánico distrés respiratorio o insuficiencia respiratoria aguda señalando que podrán reflejarse causas intermedias si las hubiera o se conocieran como neumonía sepsis o coagulopatía
 el segundo escenario es aquel en el que los casos de covid 19 se han confirmado mediante test de laboratorio
 en esos casos la causa fundamental deberá ser covid-19 confirmado
para cualquiera de los escenarios anteriores un tema importante es cómo se registra la comorbilidad de los pacientes fallecidos por covid-19 23 24 
 el documento de la omc señala que en el apartado otros procesos deberán recogerse las patologías o comorbilidades que conllevan un mayor riesgo de desarrollar enfermedad grave si existieran enfermedades cardiovasculares hipertensión arterial o diabetes
en ocasiones se planea la disyuntiva de morir por covid-19 o morir con covid-19 pudiendo resultar complejo determinar si es la enfermedad covid-19 la causante del proceso de la muerte o lo es una patología previa
 aquí sólo cabe la reflexión del facultativo que firma el certificado a la vista de los datos de la evolución clínica del paciente fallecido lo que puede requerir un estudio profundo de su historial médico
 en todo caso el contenido de los cmd-bed es valorado con posterioridad por los profesionales de los registros de mortalidad permitiendo modificaciones de la causa fundamental tras el estudio de la historia clínica y la comunicación en su caso con el profesional que en su momento hubiera certificado el fallecimiento
el documento del cgcom se basaba en la guía internacional de la oms para la certificación del covid-19 que posteriormente se ha modificado en una publicación del 16 de abril de 2020 que recoge ejemplos para la certificación de muertes no covid-19 25
en cuanto a la codificación de las muertes la oms establece el código u07
1 para los fallecimientos por covid-19 confirmados mediante estudio analítico y u07
2 para los fallecimientos sin test confirmatorios en los que el diagnostico se basa en criterios clínicos yo epidemiológicos de covid-19 probable o sospechoso 26 
a los efectos de toma de decisiones define y diferencia casos sospechosos o probables este documento define en los que sobreviven a la enfermedad como caso probable mientras no exista comunicación telemática puede ser útil establecer procedimientos excepcionales como el que se ha establecido en castilla la mancha 33 
 otras propuestas como la participación de los institutos de medicina legal y ciencias forenses imlcf en sistemas específicos de vigilancia de la mortalidad permitiría conocer en tiempo real los fallecimientos y sus causas en circunstancias tan excepcionales como las vividas
 esta participación se sustenta en la supervisión de los cmd-bed que realizan los médicos forenses en funciones de médicos del rc en algunos imlcf en españa
 este cpmetido generalmente circunscrito a los grandes municipios podría ampliarse al control de los cmd-bed recibidos en todas las oficinas de rc de esa comunidad
 así los imlcf trasladarían diariamente la información de los cmd-bed a los servicios de salud pública de cada comunidad
 esta participación que se ha llevado a cabo de manera exitosa en castilla y león aportaría un gran valor añadido a los circuitos de notificación habituales
desde el punto de vista práctico debemos poder contar con suficientes certificados de defunción certificados a los que se tiene acceso en los com provinciales
 ante una situación de pandemia y especialmente con medidas de confinamiento se deben prever mecanismos de remisión rápidos y sencillos entre los com y los servicios funerarios yo asistenciales
como conclusión señalamos que la cumplimentación del cmd-bed es un acto médico trascendente que requiere una valoración integral de la patobiografía del paciente y que ayuda a humanizar el trato a las familias en circunstancias de padecimiento emocional intensas
 se debe mejorar los métodos de comunicación de la mortalidad estableciendo la posibilidad de certificación telemática
 en circunstancias de epidemias y pandemias es necesario que se emitan recomendaciones claras sobre la certificación por parte de organismos oficiales y establecer si no es posible la comunicación telemática circuitos más ágiles que permitan conocer la mortalidad en tiempo real
  
 protein profiles of golgi-enriched fractions isolated from s
 typhimurium-infected cells were compared with those of mock-infected cells revealing significant depletion or enrichment of 105 proteins

 helms salmonella typhimurium a gram-negative bacterium is a serovar of the species salmonella enterica
 enterica serovars cause a variety of different diseases in man and other animals
 typhimurium infections are a major cause of foodborne illness in humans throughout the world
 typhimurium infection usually leads to a self-limiting gastroenteritis
 enterica serovar typhi 1 2 3 
 investigations into hostpathogen interactions by s
 typhimurium therefore increase not only our understanding of the pathogenesis of gastroenteritis but also that of typhoid fever
 typhimurium can infect both macrophages and epithelial cells
 once the epithelial barrier has been passed they can infect macrophages adjacent to the epithelial layer 4 5 
 the infection of epithelial cells is a crucial step in salmonella infection
 the bacterium invades this type of cells by inducing its own uptake
 for this purpose it employs a specialized secretion apparatus called a type three secretion system t3ss
 these effector proteins modify host cell functions to the benefit of the bacterium
 once inside the host cell the bacterium resides in a so-called salmonellacontaining vacuole scv
 drug-induced disruption of the golgi apparatus has been demonstrated to decrease salmonella replication 29 
 in addition to positioning itself in the golgi region during replication s
 typhimurium can also redirect host secretory traffic
 this results in the accumulation of exocytic cargo vesicles post-golgi vesicles in close proximity of the scv 31 
 thus during infection salmonella interacts with the host cell secretory pathway in several ways
 however the details of these interactions and the host proteins involved are largely unknown
 insight into the interplay between salmonella and the host is important for our understanding of salmonella infection
to investigate salmonella-host interactions in more detail we used a quantitative proteomics approach
 recently we applied this technique to investigate interactions of coronaviruses with the host secretory pathway 33 
 for the infection experiments wild-type s
 typhimurium strain 14028 obtained from atcc was used
 typhimurium cultures were grown in luria bertani broth lb biotrading for 16-18 h at 371c with continuous shaking

 cells were passaged in fresh medium when 80-90 confluency was reached
 the extent and efficiency of the stable isotope labeling of the hela cells were checked using maldi-tof-tof analysis
the silac procedure which was described by ong et al
 32  was performed with certain adjustments as we published previously 33 
 cells from eight culture flasks were used per experiment four flasks per labeling condition

 for each gene both oligos showed the same effect on salmonella replication reflecting the specificity of the validated oligos
 scrambled sirnas ambion and mock-transfected cells only oligofectamine were used as controls in each experiment
 forty-eight hours after sirna transfection the cells were infected with s
 typhimurium at an moi of 100 as described above
1 sds for 2 min and a dilution series was plated onto lb agar as described 44 
 the salmonella fold increase was determined by dividing the number of colony forming units cfu at 8 h p
 by the number of cfu at 1 hour p
 each sirna experiment was performed in triplicate
to validate the knockdown of the targeted genes in the sirna experiments mrna levels of each gene were determined
 rt-pcr reactions were performed on a lightcycler 480 system roche
 hela cells were infected with s
 typhimurium as described above section 2
 the cells were harvested and homogenized with the balch homogenizer gap size 9 mm
 pns was obtained after centrifugation of the cell homogenate at 1700 rpm for 10 min at 41c
 typhimurium at an moi of 100
 the cells were fixed with 3
1 saponin in pbs for 30-60 min at room temperature
we compared the protein profiles of golgi-enriched fractions from cells that were either infected with s
 typhimurium or mock-infected by applying a quantitative proteomics approach based on silac
 since salmonella replication is strongly dependent on its golgi localization 29  which occurs 4-8 h p
 we allowed infection to proceed for 6 h before golgi isolation
proteins from the isolated golgi fractions were separated by sds-page digested using in-gel tryptic digestion and subjected to lc-msms
 figure 1 shows the ratio distribution of the 765 identified proteins
 the statquant program 43 was used to calculate for which proteins the ratios differed significantly po0
org and the panther classification system protein analysis through evolutionary relationships httpwww
 the overall distribution of the 105 affected proteins was only slightly different from that of the 765 identified proteins
 the distribution of the affected proteins is somewhat changed for the cytoskeletal cyt- golgi apparatus- mitochondrial-and endosomal-localized proteins
 as the distribution of proteins among different organelles in fig
 the largest group of proteins consisted of proteins annotated to be localized to the cytoplasm
 this group contained an equal proportion of enriched and depleted proteins
 the identified proteins were also categorized according to their molecular function annotation fig
by performing rna interference experiments we validated the functional relevance of affected proteins in the salmonella infection cycle
 from the 105 affected proteins 21 proteins were selected  table 2
